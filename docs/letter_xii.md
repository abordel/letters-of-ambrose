# Letter XII
**A.D. 381**

> THIS letter, referring to the settlement of affairs in the
> East, is really addressed to Theodosius, the Emperor of the East.
> After expressing the thanks due to the Emperors for the success
> which has attended their efforts to establish the true faith
> throughout the Empire, the Bishops beg that Theodosius will use
> his influence to settle the questions of disputed succession,
> which were vexing the Churches of Alexandria and Antioch, and
> endangering the maintenance of Communion between the East and
> West. They ask therefore that a general Council may be summoned
> to Alexandria to settle both questions.

```{centered} TO THE MOST GRACIOUS AND CHRISTIAN EMPERORS, THE GLORIOUS AND MOST BLESSED PRINCES, GRATIAN, VALENTINIAN, AND THEODOSIUS, THE HOLY COUNCIL WHICH IS ASSEMBLED AT AQUILEIA
```

1\. MOST gracious Emperors and most blessed and most glorious princes,
Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius, beloved of God the Father and
of His Son our Lord Jesus Christ, we are unable to match the benefits
which your piety has conferred upon us, even with the most overflowing
return of thanks. For now that, after many times of trial and various
persecutions, which the Arians, especially Lucius[^48], who marked his
course by the impious murder of monks and virgins, and Demophilus[^49]
too, an evil source of perfidy, brought on the Catholics, all the
Churches of God, in the East especially, have been restored to the
Catholics; while in the West scarce two heretics have been found to
oppose the decrees of the Holy Council, who can conceive himself able
to make an adequate acknowledgement of your goodness?

2\. But though we cannot give full expression to your favours in words,
we still desire to recompense them by the prayers of the Council;
and though in all the several Churches we celebrate our daily vigils
for your Empire before our God, still when assembled in one body,
than which service we conceive nothing can be more glorious, we offer
thanksgivings to our Almighty God both on behalf of the Empire, and of
your own peace and safety, because peace and concord have been so shed
over us through you.

3\. In the West indeed only in two corners, on the borders of Dacia
Ripensis and of Moesia did murmurs appear to have been raised against
the faith: and these places after the sentence of the Council should,
we conceive, be immediately provided for with your Graces’ indulgence.
But over all tracts and countries and village departments as far as the
Ocean, the communion of the faithful remains one and unpolluted. And in
the East we have had the greatest joy and delight in learning that the
Arians, who had violently invaded the Churches, have been ejected, and
that the sacred temples of God are frequented by Catholics alone.

4\. But still since the envy of the Devil is never wont to rest, we hear
that there are among the Catholics themselves frequent dissensions and
implacable discord; and all our feelings are disturbed at ascertaining
that many things have been innovated upon, and that persons are
molested now who should have been relieved, men who continued always in
our Communion. In short Timotheus Bishop of the Church of Alexandria,
and Paulinus Bishop of the Church of Antioch[^50], who always maintained
the concord of Communion with us inviolate, are said to be distressed
by the variances of other persons, whose faith in former times was
scarcely stedfast. These persons, if it be possible, and they are
recommended by a sufficient faith, we would wish to have added to our
fellowship: but without prejudice to the rights of those who share with
us the ancient Communion. And our care for them is not superfluous,
first of all because the fellowship of Communion should be clear of
all offence, and secondly, because we have long since received letters
from both parties, and particularly from those who were divided in the
Church of Antioch.

5\. Indeed if the irruption of the enemy[^51] had not hindered, we had
made arrangements to send thither some of our own number, to take the
office of umpires and referees for diffusing peace again, should it be
possible. But since our desires could not have accomplishment at that
time owing to the troubles of the state, we think it right to offer
our prayers to your Goodness, asking that by agreement[^52] between
the factions, on the death of the one, the rights of the Church should
remain with the survivor, and that no additional consecration should
be forcibly attempted. And therefore we request you, most gracious
and Christian Princes, that you would have a Council of all Catholic
Bishops held at Alexandria, that they may more fully discuss and define
among themselves to whom Communion is to be imparted and with whom it
is to be maintained[^53].

6\. For though we have always supported the disposition and order of
the Church of Alexandria, and according to the manner and custom of our
predecessors we retain Communion with it in indissoluble fellowship to
these present times, still lest it should be thought that persons have
been neglected who have sought our Communion according to the agreement,
which we wish should stand, or that the shortest road to that peace and
fellowship of the faithful has not been taken, we pray you that when
they have discussed these matters in a full assembly among themselves,
the decrees of the Bishops may be furthered by the assistance
ministered by your Goodness. And allow us to be made acquainted with
this, that our minds may not waver in uncertainty, but that, full of
joy and relieved from anxiety, we may return thanks to your goodness
before Almighty God, not only that heresy is shut out, but also that
faith and concord are restored to the Catholics. The prayer which the
African and Gallic Churches offer you through their deputies is this,
that you would make the Bishops over the whole world your debtors,
though the debt already due to your excellence is not small.

7\. To offer however our entreaties to your clemency and to obtain what
we ask for, we have sent as deputies our brethren and fellow-presbyters,
whom we pray you that you would condescend graciously to listen to, and
allow to return speedily.

[^48]: This Lucius the person who, after the death of
    S. Athanasius, was forced upon the Church of Alexandria
    as Bishop, in the place of Peter who had been duly elected,
    by the Governor of the Province. His crimes and cruelties
    are recorded at length by Eccl. Hist. iv. 21, 22. He was
    eventually expelled from the see he had usurped, and is
    mentioned by Socrates, Hist. Eccl. v. 7, as afterwards
    dwelling at Constantinople and sharing the fate of
    Demophilus.

[^49]: Demophilus was originally Bishop of Beroea, (probably
    Beroea in Thrace,) and was deposed from his office for
    Arianism. In A.D. 370, on the death of Eudoxius, he was
    elected by the Arian party Bishop of Constantinople, in
    opposition to Evagrius. He was supported by Valens who was
    then Emperor, and Evagrius banished. In 380 A.D. after the
    accession of Theodosius, matters were changed. Theodosius
    offered to maintain him in his see, if he subscribed
    the Nicene Confession, but he refused, and withdrew,
    and maintained, in conjunction with Lucius and others,
    Arian worship outside the walls of Constantinople. He died
    A.D. 386. He is mentioned by S. Ambrose (De Fide 1. 6. 45.)
    as a leader of one of the various forms of Arianism.

[^50]: This refers to the long schism which had existed in the
    Church at Antioch, ever since 331 A.D. when Eustathius
    was deposed by the Arian party: in 361 A.D. Meletius
    was elected as successor to Eudoxius, having previously
    subscribed the Creed of Acacius (Socr. ii. 44.); but on
    his accepting the Nicene Creed, and acknowledging the
    Homoousion, he was deposed, and banished by the Emperor
    Constantius, and Euzoius, an Arian, appointed in his
    stead, who was afterwards succeeded by Dorotheus, (who
    was afterwards transferred to Constantinople, 385 A.D.)
    Meanwhile Meletius had returned from exile, but the
    extreme orthodox party refused to recognise him, because
    he had at first been appointed as a Semi-Arian, and
    elected Paulinus, though the Council of Alexandria had
    urged them to submit to Meletius, so that, as Socrates
    says, when recounting the Bishops of the chief sees in the
    year 379, the Church at Antioch τριχῆ διῄρητο. Paulinus
    was supported by the Church of Alexandria and by the
    Bishops of the West, and, as appears from the statements
    of this letter, a compromise had been proposed, that
    when either Meletius or Paulinus died, both parties would
    acknowledge the survivor. The Bishops at Aquileia urge
    the Emperor to enforce this, not aware that Flavian had
    already been elected as Meletius’ successor at the Council
    of Constantinople. The schism was thus perpetuated, and
    continued till 415 A.D.

    What the difficulty about Timotheus was, is not
    certain. He had been consecrated Bishop of Alexandria
    that same year, after the death of Peter, the successor of
    S. Athanasius. Tillemont (vol. x. p. 139) suggests that it
    was probably connected with the question of the succession
    at Antioch.

[^51]: The enemy are the Goths under Fritigern. See Gibbon ch. 26.

[^52]: The reading ‘pactum’ which is suggested by Valerius is
    here adopted instead of ‘factum’, which seems to give no
    satisfactory sense.

[^53]: Fleury remarks on this ‘This letter plainly shews that
    the Bishops who were there present (i. e. at the Council
    of Aquileia) either did not acknowledge the Council which
    had been lately held at Constantinople to be an Œcumenical
    Council, or that they were not yet informed of what had
    been transacted in it.
