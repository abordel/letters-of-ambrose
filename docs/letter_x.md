```{centered} THE HOLY COUNCIL WHICH IS ASSEMBLED AT AQUILEIA TO THE MOST GRACIOUS AND CHRISTIAN EMPERORS, AND MOST BLESSED PRINCES, GRATIAN, VALENTINIAN, AND THEODOSIUS
```

1\. BLESSED be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has
given you the Roman empire, and blessed be our Lord Jesus Christ,
the only-begotten Son of God, Who guards your reign with His
loving-kindness, before Whom we return you thanks, most gracious
Princes, that you have both proved the earnestness of your own faith
in that you were zealous to assemble the Council of Bishops for the
removal of disputes, and that in your condescension you reserved for
the Bishops the honourable privilege that no one should be absent who
wished to attend, and none should be constrained to attend against his
will.

```{margin}
**Ps. xli. 1. C.P.T.**

2\. Therefore according to the directions of your Graces we have
met together without the odium of large numbers and with zeal for
discussion, nor were any of the Bishops found to be heretics, except
Palladius and Secundianus, names of ancient perfidy, on whose account
people from the farthest portions of the Roman world demanded that a
Council should be summoned. None however, loaded with the years of a
long life, whose gray hairs alone would be entitled to reverence, was
compelled to come from the most distant recesses of the Ocean: and yet
nothing was lacking to the Council: no one dragging a feeble frame,
weighed down by his campaigns of fasting, was forced by the hardships
of his journey to lament the inconvenience of his loss of strength;
no one finally, being without the means of coming, had to mourn over
a poverty honourable to a Bishop. So that what the divine Scripture
has praised was fulfilled in you, most merciful of Princes, Gratian,
_Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy_.

3\. But what a hardship would it have been that on account of two
Bishops only, who are rotten in perfidy, the Churches over the whole
world should be left destitute of their Bishops. But though owing to
the distance of the journey they could not come personally, nearly
all from all the western provinces were present by the sending of
deputies, and proved by manifest attestations that they hold what we
assert and that they agree in the formula of the Council of Nicæa, as
the documents hereto attached declare. Therefore the prayers of the
nations are now in concert every where on behalf of your Empire, and
yet assertors of the Faith have not been wanting to your decision. For
though the directions of our predecessors, from which it is impious
and sacrilegious to deviate, were plain enough, still we gave them the
opportunity of discussion.

4\. And in the first instance we examined the very beginning of the
question which had arisen, and we thought fit to hear recited the
letter of Arius, who is found to be the author of the Arian heresy,
from whom also the heresy received its name, the arrangement being thus
far even favourable to them, that since they had been in the habit of
denying that they were Arians they might either by censure condemn the
blasphemies of Arius, or by argument maintain them, or at least not
refuse the name of the person, whose impiety and perfidy they followed.
But inasmuch as they could not condemn and were unwilling to support
their Founder, after they had themselves, three days before, challenged
us to a discussion, fixing place and time, and gone forth to it without
waiting to be summoned, on a sudden the very individuals, who had said
that they would easily prove that they were Christians, (which we heard
with pleasure, and hoped that they would prove,) began to shrink from
the engagement on the spot and to decline the discussion.

5\. Yet had we much discourse with them: the divine Scriptures were set
forth in the midst; and they had the offer made to them of a patient
discussion from sun-rise to the seventh hour of the day. And would
that they had said little, or that we could cancel what we heard. For
when Arius by saying in sacrilegious words that the Father was alone
eternal, alone good, alone true God, alone possessing immortality,
alone wise and alone powerful, had intended that the Son by an impious
inference should be understood to be without these attributes, these
men have preferred following Arius to confessing that the Son of God
is everlasting God and very God, and good God and wise and powerful
and possessing immortality. We spent several hours to no purpose. Their
impiety waxed greater and could in no wise be corrected.

6\. At last when they saw that they were pressed by the sacrileges of
Arius’ letter, (which we have appended in order that even your Graces
might shrink from it) they started away in the middle of the reading
of the letter, and asked us to answer what they proposed. Though it
lay not within either order or reason that we should interrupt the
plan laid down, and though we had already answered that they were
to condemn the impieties of Arius and then we would answer about
whatever proposals of theirs they pleased, preserving order and plan,
we notwithstanding acceded to their unreasonable wish: on which,
falsifying the scriptures of the Gospel, they stated to us that our
Lord said, _He that sent Me is greater than I_: whereas the course of
the Scriptures teaches us that it is written otherwise.

7\. They were convicted of the falsehood even to confession: they were
not however corrected by reason. For when we said that the Son is
called less than the Father in respect to his taking flesh upon Him,
but is proved according to the testimonies of the Scriptures to be like
and equal to the Father in respect of His Godhead, and that there could
not be degrees of any distinction or greatness, when there was unity of
power; they not only would not correct their error; but began to carry
their madness further, so as even to say that the Son is subject in
respect of His divinity, as if there could be any subjection of God in
respect of His Divinity and Majesty. In short they refer His death not
to the mystery of our salvation, but to some infirmity of His Godhead.

8\. We shudder, most gracious Princes, at such dire sacrileges, and
such wicked teachers, and that they might not any longer deceive the
people of whom they had a hold, we judged that they should be degraded
from the Priesthood, since they agreed with the impieties of the book
put before them. For it is not reasonable that they should claim to
themselves the Priesthood of Him Whom they have denied. We appeal
to your faith and your glory that you would shew the respect of your
government to Him Who is the author of it, and judge that the assertors
of impiety and debauchers of the truth be kept away from the threshold
of the Church, by an order of your Graces issued to the competent
authorities, and that Holy Bishops be put into the place of the
condemned ones by deputies of our humble appointment.

9\. The Presbyter Attalus[^41] too who avows his error and adheres to
the sacrilegious doctrines of Palladius is included under a similar
sentence. For why should we speak of his master Julianus Valens[^42]?
who although he was close at hand shunned coming to the Council of
Bishops for fear he should be compelled to account to the Bishops for
the ruin of his country, and his treason to his countrymen: a man, who,
polluted with the impiety of the Goths, presumed, as is asserted, to go
forth in the sight of a Roman army, wearing like a Pagan a collar and
bracelet: which is unquestionably a sacrilege not only in a Bishop, but
also in any Christian whatever: for it is alien to the Roman customs.
It may be that the idolatrous priests of the Goths commonly go forth in
such guise.

10\. Let your piety be moved by the title of Bishop, which that
sacrilegious person dishonours, convicted as he is of atrocious crime
even by the voice of his own people, if indeed any of his own people
can still survive. Let him at least return to his own home, and cease
to contaminate the most flourishing cities of Italy; at present by
unlawful ordinations he is associating with himself persons like
himself, and he endeavours by help of all abandoned individuals to
leave behind him a seed-plot of his own impiety and perfidy: whereas he
has not so much as begun to be a Bishop. For, to begin with, at Petavio
he was put in the place of the holy Marcus, a Bishop whose memory is
highly esteemed: but, having been disgracefully degraded by the people,
unable to remain at Petavio, he has been riding in state at Milan,
after the overthrow, say rather the betrayal, of his country.

11\. Deign then, most pious princes, to deal with all these matters,
lest we should appear to have met to no purpose, when we obeyed your
Graces’ injunctions: for care must be taken that not only our decisions
but yours also be saved from dishonour. We must request therefore that
your Graces would be pleased to listen indulgently to the deputies
of the Council, Holy men, and bid them to return speedily with
accomplishment of what we ask for, that you may receive a reward from
Christ our Lord and God, Whose Church you have cleansed from all stain
of sacrilegious persons.

12\. With respect to the Photinians also, whom by a former law you
forbad forming assemblies, revoking at the same time the law which had
been passed for the assembling of a Council of Bishops[^43], we request
of your Graces, that as we have ascertained that they are attempting
to hold assemblies in the town of Sirmium, you would by now again
interdicting their meetings, cause respect to be paid, in the first
place to the Catholic Church, and next to your own laws, that with God
for your Patron you may be triumphant, while you provide for the peace
and tranquillity of the Church.

[^41]: There is no mention of the condemnation of Attalus in the
    Records, another proof that they are not complete.

[^42]: Julianus Valens was Bishop of Petavio or Pettau on the
    Drave, into which See he had apparently been introduced
    in the place of the orthodox Bishop Marcus: for this
    is, according to Tillemont, the meaning of the word
    ‘superpositus.’ When Pannonia and Illyricum were overrun
    by the Goths after Valens’ defeat at Hadrianople, (378 A.D.)
    he deserted his charge. The ravages of the Barbarians
    are described by S. Jerome ad cap i. Zephan. vol. iii.
    p. 1645. See Gibbon ch. 26. (from a note in Newman’s Fleury,
    vol. 1 p. 38.)

[^43]: The reading here is uncertain. Ed. Rom. has ‘prout jam et
    sacerdotum concilio sententia in eos lata est.’ Nor is it
    certain to what laws allusion is made. A long note in Ed.
    Ben. does not seem to clear up the matter.
