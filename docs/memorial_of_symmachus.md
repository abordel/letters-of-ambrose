# The Memorial of Symmachus, Prefect of the City

>  THE occasion on which this Memorial was presented is stated in
>  the introduction to the last letter. It is addressed formally
>  to the three Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius, but
>  really to Valentinian only, who was at that time sole Emperor
>  of the West. Symmachus was the leading orator and scholar of
>  his day, and his plea is composed with much skill and vigour.
>  Gibbon (ch. xxviii.) expresses hearty admiration of the caution
>  with which he ‘avoids every topic which might appear to reflect
>  on the religion of his sovereign, and artfully draws his
>  arguments from the schools of rhetoric rather than from those
>  of philosophy,’ and gives a summary of its contents in a tone of
>  keen appreciation, as might be expected. We may allow, with Cave
>  (Life of S. Ambrose 3, 3.) that ‘it was the best plea the cause
>  would bear.’

1\. AS soon as the honourable Senate, ever faithful to your Majesty,
learnt that offences were made amenable to law, and that the character
of past times was being redeemed by pious governors, it hastened to
follow the precedent of better times, and give utterance to its long
repressed grief, and commissioned me once more to be the spokesman of
its complaints, for I was before refused access to the deceased Emperor
by evil men, because otherwise justice could never have failed me, most
noble Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius and Arcadius, victorious and
triumphant, ever illustrious.

2\. Filling then a twofold office, as your Prefect I report the
proceedings of the Senate[^70], as the envoy of the citizens I offer to
your favourable notice their requests. Here is no opposition of wills.
Men have ceased to believe that disagreement proves their superiority
in courtly zeal. To be loved, to be the object of respect and affection
is more than sovereignty. Who could suffer private contests to injure
the commonwealth? Justly does the Senate assail those who prefer their
own power to the honour of the prince.

3\. It is our duty to be watchful for your Majesties. The very glory of
this present time makes it the more fitting that we should maintain the
customs of our ancestors, the laws and destinies of our country; for
it conduces to this glory that you should know it is not in your power
to do anything contrary to the practice of your parents. We ask the
restoration of that state of religion under which the Republic has so
long prospered. Let the Emperors of either sect and either opinion be
counted up; a late Emperor observed the rites of his ancestors, his
successor did not abolish them. If the religion of older times is no
precedent, let the connivance of the last Emperors[^71] be so.

4\. Who is so friendly with the barbarians as not to require an altar
of Victory? Hereafter we must be cautious, and avoid a display of
such things. But let at least that honour be paid to the name which
is denied to the Divinity[^72]. Your fame owes much, and will owe still
more, to Victory. Let those detest this power, who were never aided by
it, but do you not desert a patronage which favours your triumphs. Vows
are due to this power from every man, let no one deny that a power is
to be venerated which he owns is to be desired.

5\. But even if it were wrong to avoid this omen, at least the ornaments
of the Senate-house ought to have been spared. Permit us, I beseech you,
to transmit in our old age to our posterity what we ourselves received
when boys. Great is the love of custom. And deservedly was the act
of the deified Constantius of short duration. You ought to avoid all
precedents which you know to have thus been reversed. We are solicitous
for the endurance of your name and glory, and that a future age may
find nothing to amend.

6\. Where shall we swear to observe your laws and statutes? by what
sanction shall the deceitful mind be deterred from bearing false
witness? All places indeed are full of God, nor is there any spot where
the perjured can be safe, but it is of great efficacy in restraining
crime to feel that we are in the presence of sacred things. That altar
binds together the concord of all, that altar appeals to the faith
of each man, nor does any thing give more weight to our decrees than
that all our decisions are sanctioned, so to speak, by an oath. A door
will thus be opened to perjury, and this is to be approved of by the
illustrious Emperors, allegiance to whom is guarded by a public oath!

7\. But Constantius, of sacred memory, is said to have done the same
thing. Be it so, let us then imitate his other actions, feeling
sure that had any one committed this error before his time, he would
never have fallen into it. For the fall of one is a warning to his
successor, and the censure of a previous example causes amendment. It
was allowable for this predecessor of your Majesties to incur offence
in a novel matter, but how can the same excuse avail us, if we imitate
that which we know was disapproved?

8\. Will your Majesties listen to other acts of this same Emperor more
worthy of your imitation? He left uncurtailed the privileges of the
sacred virgins, he filled the priestly office with men of noble birth,
he allowed the cost of the Roman ceremonies, and following the joyful
Senate through all the streets of the eternal city, he beheld with
serene countenance the temples, reading the names of the gods inscribed
on their pediments, he enquired after the origin of the sacred edifices,
and admired their founders. Although he himself professed another
religion he maintained the ancient one for the Empire; for every man
has his own customs, his own rites. The Divine mind has distributed
to cities various guardians and various ceremonies. As each man that
is born receives a soul, so do nations receive a genius who guards
their destiny. Here the proof from utility comes in, which is our best
voucher with regard to the Deity. For since our reason is in the dark,
what better knowledge of the gods can we have than from the record
and evidence of prosperity? And if a long course of years give their
sanction to a religion, we ought to keep faith with so many centuries,
and to follow our parents, as they followed with success those who
founded them.

9\. Let us suppose Rome herself to approach, and address you in these
terms: ‘Excellent Emperors, Fathers of your country, respect these
years to which pious rites have conducted me. Let me use the ancient
ceremonies, for I do not repent of them. Let me live in my own way,
for I am free. This worship reduced the world under my laws; these
sacred rites repulsed Hannibal from the walls, and the Gauls from the
Capitol. Am I reserved for this, to be censured in my old age? I am not
unwilling to consider the proposed decree, and yet late and ignominious
is the reformation of old age.’

10\. We pray therefore for a respite for the gods of our fathers and
our native gods[^73]. That which all venerate should in fairness be
accounted as one. We look on the same stars, the heaven is common to
us all, the same world surrounds us. What matters it by what arts each
of us seeks for truth? We cannot arrive by one and the same path at so
great a secret; but this discussion belongs rather to persons at their
ease, it is prayers not arguments which we now offer.

11\. What advantage accrues to your treasury from the abolition of the
privilege of the Vestal virgins? Shall that be denied under princes the
most munificent which the most parsimonious have granted? Their sole
honour consists in their wages, so to speak, of chastity. As their
fillets adorn their heads, so is it esteemed by them an honour to be
free to devote themselves to the ministry of sacrifices. It is but the
bare name of exemption which they ask, for their poverty exonerates
them from any payment. So that he who reduces their means, contributes
to their praise, for virginity dedicated to the public welfare is
meritorious in proportion as it is without reward.

12\. Far be such gains from the purity of your treasury. The exchequer
of good princes should be replenished by the spoils of enemies, not by
the losses of ministers of religion. And is the gain any compensation
for the odium? Those whose ancient resources are cut off only feel it
the more acutely in that you are free from the charge of avarice. For
under Emperors who keep their hands from other men’s goods and check
desire what does not excite the cupidity of the spoiler must be taken
solely with a view of injuring the person robbed.

13\. The Imperial Exchequer retains also lands bequeathed by the will
of dying persons to the sacred virgins and priests. I implore you, as
Priests of justice, to restore to the sacred functionaries of your city
the right of inheritance. Let men dictate their wills in peace, knowing
that under equitable princes their bequests will be undisturbed.
Men are wont to take pleasure in this security, and I would have you
sympathise with them, for the precedent lately set has begun to harass
them on their death-beds. Shall it be said that the religion of Rome
appertains not to Roman laws? What name shall we give to the taking
away of legacies which no law no casualty has made void? Freedmen may
take legacies, slaves are allowed[^74] a due latitude of bequeathing by
will, only the noble virgins and ministers of sacred rites are excluded
from inheriting lands devised to them. What advantage is it to dedicate
one’s virginity to the public safety, and to support the immortality of
the empire with heavenly protection, to conciliate friendly powers to
your arms and eagles, to take upon oneself vows salutary for all, and
to refrain from commerce with mankind in general? Slavery then is a
happier condition, whose service is given to men. It is the state which
is wronged, whose interest it never is to be ungrateful.

14\. Let me not be supposed to be defending the cause of the ancient
religions only; from acts of this kind all the calamities of the Roman
nation have arisen. The laws of our ancestors provided for the Vestal
virgins and the ministers of the gods a moderate maintenance and just
privileges. This gift was preserved inviolate till the time of the
degenerate moneychangers, who diverted the maintenance of sacred
chastity into a fund for the payment of base porters. A public famine
ensued on this act, and a bad harvest disappointed the hopes of all the
provinces. The soil was not here in fault, we ascribe no influence to
the stars, no mildew blighted the crops, nor did tares choke the corn,
it was sacrilege which rendered the year barren, for it was necessary
that all should lose that which they had denied to religion.

15\. By all means, if there is any instance of such an evil, let us
attribute this famine to the effect of the seasons. An unhealthy wind
has caused this blight, and so life is supported by means of shrubs and
leaves, and the peasants in their want have had resource once more to
the oaks of Dodona[^75]. When did the provinces suffer such a calamity,
so long as the ministers of religion were supported by the public
bounty? When were oaks shaken for the food of man, when were roots dug
up, when were opposite regions of the earth cursed with sterility, so
long as provisions were furnished in common to the people and to the
sacred virgins? The produce of the earth was blessed by its support of
the priests, and thus the gift was rather in the nature of a safeguard
than of a largess. Can it be doubted that the gift was for the common
benefit, now that a general scarcity has attended its dis continuance?

16\. But it may be said that public aid is rightly refused to the
cost of an alien religion. Far be it from good rulers to suppose that
what has been bestowed from the common stock on certain individuals is
within the disposal of the Imperial treasury. For as the commonwealth
consists of individuals, so that which comes from it becomes again the
property of individuals. You govern all, but you preserve for each his
own, and justice has more power with you than arbitrary will. Consult
your own generous feelings, whether that ought still to be deemed
public property which has been conferred on others. Gifts once devoted
to the honour of the city are placed out of the power of the donors,
and that which originally was a free-gift becomes by usage and
length of time a debt. Vain therefore is the fear which they would
impress upon your minds who assert that unless you incur the odium of
withdrawing the gift you share the responsibility of the donors of it.

17\. May the unseen patrons of all sects be propitious to your Majesties,
and may those in particular who of old assisted your ancestors, aid
you and be worshipped by us. We ask for that religious condition which
preserved the empire to your Majesties’ father[^76], and blessed him
with lawful heirs. That venerable sire beholds from his starry seat the
tears of the priests, and feels himself censured by the infraction of
that custom which he readily observed.

18\. I beg you also to amend for your departed brother what he did by
the advice of others, to cover the act by which he unknowingly offended
the Senate. For it is certain that the reason why the embassage was
refused admittance was, to prevent the decision of the state from
reaching him. It is due to the credit of past times to abolish without
hesitation that which has been found not to have been the doing of the
Emperor.


[^70]: The Præfectus Urbi at this time ‘was regarded as the
      direct representative of the Emperor,’ and, among other
      duties, ‘he had every month to make a report to the
      Emperor of the transactions of the Senate,’ and also
      was ‘the medium through which the Emperors received the
      petitions and presents from their capital.’ Dict. of Ant.
      sub voc.

[^71]: By the ‘late emperor’ is meant Julian; ‘his successor’ is
      Valentinian the 1st, and ‘last Emperors’ are Valentinian
      the 1st and Valens.

[^72]: There is a play here on the words ‘nomen’ and ‘numen.’

[^73]: Symmachus is thinking of Virgil’s invocation,\
       Di patrii, Indigetes, et Romule, Vestaque Mater, &c.\
       Georg. i. 498.

       The Di patrii are explained as being those brought by
       Æneas into Italy, Indigetes those native to the soil of
       Italy.

[^74]: In strict law a slave’s peculium was the property of his
       owner, but custom had allowed it to be regarded his own
       property.

[^75]: Another trace of Virgil:

       Cum jam glandes atque arbuta sacræ\
       Deficerent silvæ et victum Dodona negaret.\
       Georg. i. 158.

[^76]: Valentinian the 1st, as Symmachus mentions above, had
       tolerated the heathen rites, and this he here represents
       as having availed to win the special favour of the gods.
