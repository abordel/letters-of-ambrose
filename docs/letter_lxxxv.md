# Letter LXXXV

> S. AMBROSE thanks Siricius for sending him letters by the
> Presbyter Syrus, whose speedy return he promises.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO SIRICIUS
```

1\. I AM always pleased to receive a letter from you, but when you
also send to me some of our fellow servants, as you have now given our
brother and co-presbyter Syrus a letter to me, my joy is doubled. I
would however that this pleasure had been more lasting; for as soon as
he had arrived he thought he must return, and this diminished my regret
and added greatly to my estimation of him.

2\. For I love those presbyters and deacons who when they have performed
their mission will not allow themselves to remain absent any longer
from their duties. For the prophet says, _I have not been weary in
following thee_. And who can be weary in following Jesus, when He
Himself says, _Come unto Me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest_. Let us therefore never cease from following
Jesus, which if we do we shall never fail, for He gives strength to
them that follow Him. The more nearly you approach to the Source of
power the stronger you will be.

3\. Often, while we are thus following Him, the adversaries say to us,
_Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now_. But let us not grow
weary in following Him, let us not be turned aside by meeting with this
crafty question. It was said to the prophet, when he was thrown into
prison, when he was cast into the pit of mire, _Where is the word of
the Lord? let it come now_. But he followed him so much the more, and
therefore attained the prize, and received the crown; for following
Jesus he was not weary; for _there is no weariness in Jacob, neither
shall sorrow be in Israel_.

Farewell; love me, for I love one who loves me, and whom I regard as a
father.
