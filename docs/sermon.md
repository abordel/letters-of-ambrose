```{centered} AGAINST AUXENTIUS ON THE GIVING UP THE BASILICAS
```

>  THE persecution against S. Ambrose still continued. The Court
>  party endeavoured to induce him to leave Milan, in order, they
>  said, to prevent more serious troubles. This he refused to do,
>  and at last he remained for several days and nights continuously
>  within the Basilica[^113], attended by a crowded congregation,
>  all determined to protect him from the violence of the court,
>  while a guard of soldiers was at the same time blockading the
>  Church, and preventing any from leaving it. It was during this
>  time that this Sermon was preached. In it S. Ambrose first calms
>  the fears of the people lest he should be induced to leave them,
>  assuring them that he will only yield to force; and proceeds
>  to apply the Lessons of the day, the story of Naboth and the
>  Entry into Jerusalem, to the circumstances of the time, giving
>  incidentally several interesting details of the contest between
>  himself and the Court, and alluding to the hymns which he then
>  taught the people to sing.

1\. I SEE that you are in an unusual state of excitement, and that your
eyes are fixed upon me. I am at a loss to know the cause of this. Is
it that you saw or heard that an Imperial message has been brought to
me by the Tribunes, commanding me to depart hence whither I would, and
that all who would were permitted to follow me. Were you then alarmed
lest I should desert the Church, and in fear for my own life abandon
you? But you heard my answer. I said that the thought of deserting the
Church could not for an instant enter my mind, for I feared the Lord
of the Universe more than the Ruler of the Empire; that if I were to be
forcibly removed from the Church, it would be my body not my mind which
would be driven by violence from thence, that if the Emperor were to
act as royal power is wont, I was prepared for that which is the part
of a priest to suffer.

2\. Why then are you thus disturbed? I will never desert you of my own
will, but I may not repel force by force. I shall still be able to
mourn, to weep, and to groan; when weapons, soldiers, Goths assail me,
my tears are my weapons, for these are the defence of a priest. By any
other means I neither can nor ought to resist; but to fly and desert
the Church is not my wont, lest any one should impute it to fear of
heavier punishment. You yourselves know that I am wont to pay deference
to our Rulers, but not to give way to them, and willingly to offer
myself to punishment, not fearing what is prepared for me.

3\. Would that I could be satisfied that the Church would not be
delivered to heretics! I would willingly go to the Emperor’s palace,
were this accordant with the priest’s office, so as to hold our
contest rather in the palace than in the Church. But in the Consistory
Christ is not wont to be the accused, but the Judge. Who will deny
that a matter of faith should be pleaded in the Church? If any one has
confidence in his cause let him come hither; let him not look for the
judgment of the Emperor, which already shews its leaning, which has
declared plainly by the law he has enacted that he is adverse to the
Faith, nor for the expected support of certain intriguers. I will not
give occasion to any one to barter for gain a wrong to Christ.

```{margin}
**1 S. Pet. v. 8**
```

4\. The guard of soldiers and the din of the arms which beset the Church,
alarm not my faith, but they make me fear that in keeping me here you
may incur danger to yourselves. For I have learned ere this not to fear
for myself, but I begin now to fear more for you. Permit, I beg, your
Bishop to enter the lists; we have an adversary who challenges us; for
our _adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom
he may devour_, as the Apostle saith. Doubtless he has obtained, he has
obtained (not to deceive us, but to warn us, is it recorded) this power
of temptation, lest haply I should be removed from the stedfastness of
my faith by the wounds of my body. You also have read that the devil
thus tempted holy Job in many ways; and last of all he begged and
obtained the power of afflicting his body which he covered with sores.

5\. When it was proposed to me to give up at once the Church plate,
I made this reply; That if my own property was required of me, farm
or house, gold or silver, anything that lies in my power, I would
willingly give it; but that I would withdraw nothing from God’s temple,
nor surrender what had been committed to me to keep, not to surrender.
And further, that I was studying also for the Emperor’s good, for it
was expedient neither for me to surrender nor for him to receive these
things; let him then listen to the words of an independent Bishop: if
he regard his own interest, let him abstain from doing wrong to Christ.

```{margin}
**Eph. vi. 12.**
```

6\. These are words full of humility, and, I believe, of that affection
which a Bishop owes to his Emperor. But since _our contest is not only
against flesh and blood, but_ also (which is more trouble) _against
spiritual wickedness in high places_, that tempter, the Devil, sharpens
the contest by his ministers, and deems that by the wounds of my body
the trial must be made. I know, brethren, that these wounds which we
receive for Christ, are no wounds: life is not lost by them, but its
seed propagated. Permit, I beseech you, the contest to take place, it
is for you to be spectators only. Consider that if there is in a city
an athlete or one skilled in some other science, it wishes to present
him for the combat. Why do ye reject in greater things what ye are wont
to wish for even in smaller ones? He fears neither arms nor barbarians,
who dreads not death, who is entangled in no fleshly pleasure.

7\. Without doubt if the Lord hath appointed me to this combat, it is in
vain that you have kept sleepless watch and ward through so many nights
and days; the will of Christ will be performed. For our Lord Jesus
Christ is Almighty, this is our Faith; and therefore what He bids to
be done will be fulfilled, nor does it become us to run counter to the
Divine Will.

8\. Ye have heard what has been read to-day: the Saviour commanded an
ass’s colt to be brought to Him by the Apostles and commanded that if
any one sought to hinder them they should say, _The Lord hath need of
him_. What if now also He hath commanded this ass’s colt, that is the
colt of that animal which is wont to bear a heavy burthen, such as is
the condition of man, to whom it is said, _Come unto Me all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest: take My yoke upon
you, for My yoke is easy_: what, I say, if He hath now commanded this
colt to be brought to Him, sending forth those Apostles who now having
put off the body, wear, invisibly to our eyes, the guise of Angels?
Will they not say, should any one seek to hinder them, _The Lord hath
need of him_, if either the desire of this life, or flesh and blood,
or the conversation of the world, for perhaps we are acceptable to some
persons, should seek to hinder them? But he who loves me here, cannot
give a better testimony of his affection than by suffering me to become
a sacrifice for Christ; because _to be dissolved and to be with Christ
is much better; howbeit, to remain in the flesh is more needful for
your sakes_. Ye have therefore, my beloved brethren, no cause for fear,
for I know that whatever I shall suffer, I shall suffer for Christ. And
I have read that I ought not to fear those who can kill the flesh, and
I have heard One say, _He who loses his life for My sake, shall find
it_.

9\. Wherefore, if the Lord wills it, I am sure that no resistance will
be made. But if He still delay our contest, why should we fear? It
is not bodily protection but the Lord’s providence which is wont to
protect the servant of Christ.

10\. You are disturbed at finding some folding doors unclosed which a
blind man in returning home is said to have opened. Acknowledge then
that human guards are no support. Lo! one who had lost the gift of
sight has broken through all your barriers and baffled your guards: but
the Lord hath not lost[^114] the guard of His mercy. Do you not remember
that two days ago there was found open an entrance on the left side of
the Basilica which you thought to be closed and guarded? The Basilica
was surrounded by armed men who inspected every entrance, but their
eyes were blinded so that they could not discover the one which was
open; and so it remained open, as you know, for many nights. Cease then
all anxiety, for what Christ commands, and what is expedient, shall
come to pass.

```{margin}
**2 Kings vi. 16. (the sense, not the words.)**
```

11\. In the next place I will produce to you instances from the Old
Testament. Elisha was sought after by the king of Syria, an army was
sent to take him, he was surrounded on every side, his servant began
to fear, because he was a servant, that is, his mind was not free, nor
had he freedom of action. The holy prophet prayed that his eyes might
be opened, and said, _Look and see how many more are on our side than
against us_. And he looked up and saw thousands of Angels. You see then
that the servants of Christ are protected rather by invisible than by
visible beings. But when they keep guard around you, they have been
called to do so by your prayers; for you have read that those very men
who sought for Elisha on entering Samaria came upon the very man whom
they wished to capture, yet they were not able to injure him, but were
saved by the intercession of the very man against whom they came.

12\. Take the Apostle Peter too as an example of both these things. When
Herod sought after and took him, he was put in prison; for the servant
of God had not fled but stood firm and without fear. The Church prayed
for him, but the Apostle was asleep in the prison, a proof that he
feared not. An Angel was sent to rouse him from his sleep, and by him
Peter was brought out of prison and for the time escaped death.

```{margin}
**Rom. vi. 10.**
```

13\. The same Peter, afterwards, after overcoming Simon, by spreading
the precepts of God among the people and preaching chastity, stirred up
the minds of the heathen against him: and when they sought to put him
to death the Christians besought him to retire for a little while. And
although he was desirous of suffering, yet he was moved by the sight
of the people praying, for they besought him to reserve himself for
the instruction and confirmation of the people. To be brief: as he
set out from the walls by night, he saw Christ meeting him in the gate
and entering the city, whereupon he said, ‘Lord, whither goest Thou?’
Christ answered, ‘I am coming to be crucified again.’ This Divine
response Peter understood to refer to his own cross, for Christ, Who
had put off the flesh by undergoing the suffering of death could not
again be crucified, _For in that He died, He died unto sin once, but in
that He liveth, He liveth unto God_. Wherefore Peter understood that
Christ was again to be crucified in His servant; and so he turned back
of his own accord, and when the Christians asked him why, he told them
what he had seen, and was immediately seized, and honoured the Lord
Jesus by his cross.

```{margin}
**S. John xxi. 22.**
```

14\. Ye see then that Christ wills to suffer in His servants. What if He
saith to this servant also, _I will that he tarry, but follow thou Me_?
what if He wills to taste of the fruit from this tree? For if it was
His meat to do His Father’s Will, it is His meat also to feed upon the
sufferings of His servants. To take an example from our Lord Himself,
did He not suffer when He willed, and was He not found when they sought
for Him? But when the hour of His passion had not arrived, He passed
through the midst of them who sought for Him, and they who saw Him
could not detain Him. Wh ich evidently shews that when the Lord wills,
each man is found and taken, while he whose time is not come although
he meet the eyes, is not captured.

15\. And did I not go out daily to make visits, or go to the tomb of
the Martyrs? Did I not in going and returning pass close by the Royal
palace? And yet no man arrested me, though they wished to drive me from
the city, as they shewed afterwards by saying, ‘Leave this city, and
go where thou wilt.’ I expected, I confess, something great, to be
burned or slain with the sword for the name of Christ, but they offered
me delights in the place of sufferings; and yet the soldiers of Christ
seeks not for delights but for sufferings. Wherefore let no man trouble
you by the intelligence that they have prepared a carriage[^115], or
that Auxentius, who calls himself Bishop, has uttered what he thinks
terrible words.

```{margin}
**2 Cor. xi. 14.**
```

16\. Many said that executioners had been sent, that the punishment of
death had been decreed; I fear them not, nor will I desert my post.
For whither should I go to find a place that is not full of nothing
but tears and groans? For in every Church the Catholic clergy are
ordered to be cast forth; if they resist, to be put to death; all the
senators[^116] who do not obey this mandate, to be proscribed. And it
is a Bishop who writes these orders with his own hand and dictates them
with his own mouth, who to prove his learning omitted not an ancient
precedent; for we read in the prophet that he saw a flying sickle[^117],
and in imitation of this Auxentius sent a winged sword through all the
cities. And thus _Satan transforms himself into an Angel of light_, and
imitates his power for evil purposes.

```{margin}
**Ps. l. 16.**

**2 Cor. vi. 15.**

**1 Kings xxi. 3.**
```

17\. Thou, Lord Jesus, hast in one moment redeemed the world; shall
Auxentius in one moment, so far as in him lies, slay so many people,
some with the sword, others by sacrilege[^118]? My Basilica he sought
with a mouth and hands of blood, and to him our present Lesson may be
well applied, _Unto the ungodly, saith God, why dost thou preach my
laws?_ that is, There is no concord between peace and wrath, _between
Christ and Belial_. You remember also how in the Lesson of to-day that
holy man Naboth, the owner of a vineyard, was requested by the king to
surrender it to him, that he might root up the vines and plant it with
common herbs, and that he answered, _God forbid that I should give thee
the inheritance of my fathers_; and that king was grieved that what
belonged of right to another was refused him when he claimed it as
his right, and only gained by the deceit of a woman’s artifice. Naboth
then defended his vineyard even with his own blood; if he would not
surrender his vineyard, shall we surrender the Church of Christ?

18\. How then did I reply contumaciously? When summoned, I said, ‘God
forbid that I should surrender Christ’s heritage. If Naboth would not
surrender the heritage of his fathers, shall I surrender Christ’s
heritage?’ I added moreover, ‘God forbid that I should surrender the
heritage of my fathers, the heritage of Dionysius, who died in exile
for the Faith, of the Confessor Eustorgius, of Myrocles, and of all
the faithful Bishops of old time.’ I answered as becomes a Bishop, let
the Emperor act as becomes an Emperor. He shall deprive me of my life
sooner than my Faith.

```{margin}
**S. Luke xix. 40.**
```

19\. But to whom am I to surrender it? The Lesson just read from the
Gospel ought to teach us what it is that is demanded, and by whom.
Ye heard it read that, when Christ was sitting on the ass’s colt, the
children cried out, and the Jews were indignant, appealing to the Lord
Jesus, and saying that He should bid them hold their peace, but He
replied, _If these were to hold their peace, the very stones would
cry out_. Then He entered the Temple, and cast out the moneychangers,
and their tables, and those that sold doves in the Temple of God. This
Lesson was read by no direction of ours, but by chance; but it suits
well with the present time. For the praises of Christ are always as
it were scourges to misbelievers. And now when Christ is praised the
heretics say that we are exciting sedition, the heretics say that they
were thereby threatened with death; and truly the praises of Christ
are death to them. For how can they bear His praises Whose weakness
they are proclaiming! Wherefore to this day the praises of Christ are
a scourge to the madness of the Arians.

```{margin}
**Ps. viii. 2.**

**Ps. cxviii. 22.**
```

20\. The Gerasenes could not bear the presence of Christ, these men,
worse than the Gerasenes, cannot even bear the praises of Christ. They
see children singing the glory of Christ; for it is written, _Out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise_. They
deride their tender years so full of faith, and ask, Why do they cry
out? But Christ answers them, _If these should hold their peace the
very stones would cry out_, that is, the stranger will cry out, the
young men too will cry out, the more mature will cry out, the old men
also: stones built into that Stone of Whom it is written, _The stone
which the builders disallowed is become the head-stone of the corner_.

21\. Christ then, invited by these praises, enters His Temple, and takes
His scourge and drives out the moneychangers. For He will not permit
those who are slaves of money to be in His Temple, He will not suffer
those to be there who sell seats. What are _seats_, but honours? What
are _doves_, but simple minds, or souls which embrace a sincere and
pure faith? Shall I then introduce into the Temple him whom Christ
excludes? For he is commanded to go forth who sells dignities and
honours, he is commanded to go forth who would sell the simple minds
of the faithful.

22\. Wherefore Auxentius is cast forth, Mercurianus is excluded. This
is one portent under two names. That it might not be known who he was,
he changed his name, and, as there had been here Auxentius the Arian
Bishop, so he, to deceive the people whom the other had influenced,
called himself Auxentius. Thus he changed his name, but his perfidy he
could not change; he put off wolf, and yet put on wolf. It avails him
not to have changed his name, what he really is is known. He was known
by one name in the regions of Scythia, he is called by another here, he
has names differing according to his country. Now therefore he has two
names, and if from hence he goes elsewhere he will have a third also.
For how will he endure to keep a name which betrays the greatness of
his crime? In Scythia he did less wickedly, and yet he was so ashamed
as to change his name; here he has dared to do more heinous things, and
will he be willing wherever he goes to be betrayed by his name? After
writing with his own hand the death warrant of so many people, will he
be able to retain his senses unshaken?

```{margin}
**Jer. xvii. 1.**
```

23\. The Lord Jesus drove out a few from His temple, Auxentius left no
one. Jesus casts men out of His temple with a scourge, Auxentius with a
sword; Jesus with a rod, Mercurianus with an axe. Our holy Lord drives
out the sacrilegious with a scourge, this wicked man persecutes the
godly with the sword. Of him ye have to-day said well; ‘let him carry
his laws away with him.’ He shall carry them though he desire it not,
he shall carry with him his conscience, though he carry not the writing,
he shall carry his own soul inscribed in blood, although he carry not a
letter inscribed with ink. _Thy sin, O Judah, is written with a pen of
iron and with the point of a diamond_, and _it is graven in thy heart_,
graven that is in the place from whence it came forth.

```{margin}
**Gal. ii. 19.**

**Gal. iii. 11.**
```

24\. Does he moreover, stained as he is with blood and slaughter, dare
to mention discussion to me? Those whom he fails to deceive by his
arguments he sentences to be smitten with the sword, and he dictates
bloody laws with his mouth, writing them with his hand, and thinking
that the law can impose a Creed on men. He has never heard what was
read to-day, _A man is not justified by the works of the law_, or, _I
by the law am dead to the law that I might live to God_, that is, by
the spiritual law he is dead to the carnal interpretation of the law.
Let us too by the law of our Lord Jesus Christ die to this law which
sanctions the decrees of perfidy. It is not the law which has gathered
together the Church, but the faith of Christ. For the law is not of
faith: _But the just shall live by faith_. It is faith then, not the
law, which makes a man just, because righteousness is not by the law,
but by the faith of Christ. But he who rejects faith, and takes law for
his rule, bears witness to his own unrighteousness, for _the just shall
live by faith_.

```{margin}
**Gal. iv. 4.**

**Gal. iii. 13.**

**2 Cor. v. 21.**
```

25\. Shall any then follow this law confirming the Council of Ariminum
wherein Christ is called a creature? But they say, _God sent His Son,
made of a woman, made under the Law_. So then He is _made_ they say,
that is, created. Will they not consider this very text which they
have produced; that Christ is said to be made, but _made of a woman_,
that is, He according to His birth from the Virgin was _made_, Who was
according to His Divine generation born of the Father? They read too
to-day that Christ _redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made
a curse for us_. Was Christ a curse according to His Divinity? But why
He should be called a curse the Apostle teaches thee, alleging the text,
_Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree_, that is, He Who in His
flesh took upon Him our flesh, in His body carried our griefs and our
curses that He might crucify them, for He is cursed, not in Himself,
but in thee. Lastly, you have in another place, _Who knew no sin, but
was made sin for us_, for He took upon Him our sins, to do away with
them by the Sacrament of His Passion.

26\. These points, my brethren, I would have discussed more fully with
you in his presence, but he, being aware that you were not ignorant
of the Faith, fled from your scrutiny, and chose as his advocates,
if indeed he chose any, four or five heathens, whom I would willingly
have now present in our general assembly, not for them to judge of
Christ, but that they might hear the majesty of Christ. They however
have already pronounced concerning Auxentius, for when he daily
argued before them they gave him no credit. What can be a greater
condemnation of him than that he was defeated without an adversary
before his own judges? Thus we now have their own sentence against
Auxentius.

```{margin}
**1 Cor. vi. 1, 2.**

**Ib. vi. 5.**
```

27\. And justly is he to be condemned for choosing heathen judges, for
he disregarded the Apostle’s precept who says _Dare any of you, having
a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before
the saints? Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world?_ And
below he says, _Is it so that there is not a wise man among you, no not
one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? but brother goeth
to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers?_ Ye see that what
he offered is contrary to the Apostle’s authority. Choose whether we
should follow Auxentius or Paul as our master?

```{margin}
**Isa. li. 7.**

**2 Cor. iii. 3.**
```

28\. But why should I speak of the Apostle, when our Lord Himself cries
by the Prophet, _hearken unto Me My people, ye that know righteousness,
in whose heart is My law_. God says, _hearken unto Me My people, ye
that know righteousness_. Auxentius says, Ye know not righteousness.
Do ye not see that he now, who rejects the declaration of the heavenly
oracles, despises God in you? _Hearken unto Me My people_; saith the
Lord. He says not, Hearken ye Gentiles; He says not, Hearken ye Jews.
For now they that were the people of God are become the people of error,
and they who were the people of error have become the people of God,
because they have believed in Christ. Wherefore that people are judges,
in whose heart is the Divine, not human, law; the law _written not with
ink, but with the Spirit of the living God_; not inscribed on paper but
stampt upon the heart; the law of grace not of blood. Who is it then
who wrongs you, he who refuses or he who chooses to be heard by you?

29\. Hemmed in on all sides, he has recourse to the wiles of his fathers.
He wishes to excite odium against me in regard to the Emperor, saying,
that a youth yet a catechumen and ignorant of the sacred Scriptures,
ought to judge, and to judge in the Consistory. As if last year, when
I was summoned to the palace, when in the presence of the nobles the
matter was argued before the Consistory, when the Emperor wished to
take away the Basilica, I was then cowed by the sight of the Imperial
court, and had not maintained the constancy of a priest, or had
suffered our rights to be infringed there. Do they not remember that
when the people knew I had gone to the palace they rushed in with an
onset that nothing could withstand; and when a Military Count came
forth with some light troops to disperse the multitude they all offered
themselves to death for the Faith of Christ? Was I not then requested
to make a long speech to soothe the people? Did I not pledge my faith
that no one should invade the Church’s Basilica? And although my good
offices were requested as a kindness, yet the coming of the populace to
the palace was made a ground of charge against me; into the same odium
then they wish me again to fall.

```{margin}
**S. Matt. xxii. 17.**
```

30\. I recalled the people, and yet I did not escape odium, and this
odium ought, I conceive, to be controuled rather than feared. For
what should we fear for the name of Christ? Unless perhaps this which
they say ought to move me; ‘And ought not the Emperor then to have one
Basilica to go to; and does Ambrose desire to be more powerful than the
Emperor, so as to exclude him from the liberty of attending Church?’
When they say this, they wish to lay hold of my words, like the Jews
who tempted Christ with empty words, saying, _Master, is it lawful
to give tribute to Cæsar or not?_ Must the servants of God always be
exposed to odium on Cæsar’s account? And does impiety, with a view to
calumny, seek to use the Imperial name as a cloak? And can they protest
that they do not partake of the sacrilege of these men, whose guidance
they follow?

```{margin}
**Ib. 18. sqq.**
```

31\. Yet see how much worse the Arians are than the Jews. The latter
enquired of Christ whether He thought that the right of tribute should
be rendered to Cæsar; the former are willing to surrender to the
Emperor the rights of the Church. But like traitors, they follow their
master, and so let us answer what our Lord and Master hath taught us.
For Jesus perceiving the treachery of the Jews, said unto them, _Why
tempt ye Me, shew Me a penny. And when they gave it to Him, He said,
Whose image and whose superscription is this? They answered, Cæsar’s.
Jesus replied, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s,
and unto God the things that are God’s._ Thus I also say to them who
find fault with me, _Shew Me a penny_. Jesus saw the penny was Cæsar’s,
and said, _Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God
the things that are God’s_. Can they from the seizure of the Basilicas
of the Church offer the penny of Cæsar?

32\. But in the Church I know one image, that is, the image of the
invisible God, of which God said, _Let us make man in Our image, after
Our likeness_, that image of which it is written, that Christ is _the
brightness of His glory, the express image of His substance_. In this
image I behold the Father, as the Lord Jesus Himself said, _He that
hath seen Me hath seen the Father also_. For this Image is not divided
from the Father, for He hath taught me the unity of the Trinity, saying,
_I and the Father are One_, and below, _All things that the Father hath
are Mine_. And of the Holy Spirit, saying, that He is the Spirit of
Christ, and hath received from Christ, as it is written, _He shall take
of Mine, and shall declare it unto you_.

```{margin}
**Prov. xix. 17.**
```

33\. In what respect then have we not answered with humility? If he
ask for tribute we deny it not. The Church lands pay tribute; if the
Emperor desire to possess these lands he has the power to claim them;
none of us will interfere. The contributions of the people will more
than suffice for the poor; let them excite no ill-will on account of
the lands, let them take them if it please the Emperor; I give them
not, but I do not refuse them. They ask for gold, but I can say, Silver
and gold I seek not. But this disbursement of gold they make a cause
of offence: this offence I dread not. I have stipendiaries, it is true:
my stipendiaries[^119] are the poor of Christ, this is a treasure which
I am well used to collect. May this offence of bestowing gold on the
poor ever be charged upon me! And if they accuse me of defending myself
by their means, I deny not, nay I even court the charge; a defence I
have, but it is in the prayers of the poor. Blind they are and lame,
weak and old, yet are they stronger than the stoutest warriors. Lastly,
gifts to the poor make God our debtor, for it is written, _He that
giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord_. The guards of warriors often
gain not Divine grace.

34\. Moreover they assert that the people have been beguiled by the
strains of my hymns[^120]. I deny not this either. It is a lofty strain,
than which nothing is more powerful. For what can be more powerful than
the confession of the Trinity, which is daily celebrated by the mouth
of the whole people? All zealously desire to make profession of their
faith, they know how to confess in verse the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit. Thus all are become teachers who were scarcely able to be
disciples.

35\. But what can be more lowly than for us to follow the example of
Christ, Who _being found in fashion as a man humbled himself being made
obedient unto death_. And again, by obedience He delivered all: _For
as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one Man shall many be made righteous_. If then He was
obedient let them learn from Him the lesson of obedience, to which we
adhere, saying to them who raise odium against us, on the Emperor’s
account, _We render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God
the things that are God’s_. To Cæsar tribute is due, we deny it not;
the Church is God’s, and must not be given up to Cæsar, because the
Temple of God cannot by right be Cæsar’s.

36\. That this is said with due honour to the Emperor no one can deny.
For what can be more honourable for the Emperor than to be styled a
son of the Church? In saying this we are loyal to him without sinning
against God. For the Emperor is _within_ the Church, not _over_ the
Church; a good Emperor seeks the aid of the Church, he does not reject
it, we say this humbly, but we assert it firmly. Some men threaten
us with fire, sword and banishment. We, the servants of Christ, have
learned not to fear. To them that fear not nothing is a cause of alarm.
And it is thus written, _arrows of infants are their blows become_.

37\. It would seem now that we have made a sufficient answer to what was
proposed to us. Now I ask them the same question as did the Saviour,
_The baptism of John was it from heaven or of men?_ And the Jews could
not answer Him. If the Jews did not annul the baptism of John, shall
Auxentius annul the Baptism of Christ? For that Baptism is not from
men but from Christ which the _Angel of mighty Counsel_ brought down to
us, that we might be justified before God. Why then does Auxentius hold
that the faithful, those baptized in the name of the Trinity are to be
re-baptized, when the Apostle says, _One faith, one baptism_; why does
he say that he is the adversary of men, not of Christ, seeing that he
spurns the counsel of God, and contemns that Baptism which Christ gave
us for the redemption of our sins.



[^113]: ‘This was not so great an inconvenience to them as might
        appear at first sight, for the early Basilicas were not
        unlike the heathen temples, or our own collegiate chapels,
        that is, part of a range of buildings, which contained the
        lodgings of the ecclesiastics, and formed a fortress in
        themselves, which could easily be blockaded either from
        within or without.’ Newman. Ch. of the Fathers. p. 22.

[^114]: The words ‘custodiam’ and ‘amisit,’ are repeated by
        S. Ambrose from the former part of the sentence. ‘Amisit’
        as applied here recalls the Psalmist’s expression, ‘Hath
        God forgotten to be gracious?’ Ps. lxxvii. 9.

[^115]: This refers to a story thus recounted in Paulinus’ Life
        of S. Ambrose ch. 12, ‘Among many who tried to force
        S. Ambrose into exile, but through God’s protection failed
        of their purpose, one Euthymius more hapless than the
        rest, was stirred to such a pitch of frenzy that he hired
        a house close to the Church, and there kept a carriage,
        that he might the more readily carry off Ambrose into
        exile, by seizing him and putting him in the carriage.
        But _his wickedness fell upon his own pate_, (Ps. vii. 7.)
        for that very day year, he was himself put into the
        carriage and from the same house was carried into exile,
        confessing that it was by the just judgment of God that
        his wickedness had recoiled on himself, and he was carried
        into exile in the very chariot which he had prepared for
        the Bishop. And the Bishop did much to comfort him, by
        giving him money, and other necessaries.’

[^116]: The word is ‘curiales.’ See Footnote 81 on Lett. xviii.
        To the authorities there referred to add Bingh. Antiq.
        iv, 4, 4, where Gothofred’s enumeration of their duties is
        given in full in the notes.

[^117]: Zech. v. 1 [E.V. a flying roll. Vulg. volumen volans.]

[^118]: i. e. by causing them to commit sacrilege.

[^119]: There is a play here on the word ‘aerarios,’ as connected
        with ‘aerarium’ the treasury. The aerarii were the lowest
        class of people at Rome, and so S. Ambrose calls the
        ‘pauperes Christi’ his aerarii, while at the same time
        they are the treasures of the Church.

[^120]: S. Augustine mentions in his Confessions (ix. 7.)
        S. Ambrose’s introduction both of Hymns and chanting
        during this period of trial. ‘Then was it first instituted
        that, after the manner of the Eastern Churches, Hymns
        and Psalms should be sung, lest the people should wax
        faint through the tediousness of sorrow; and from that
        day to this the custom is retained, divers, yea, almost
        all Thy Congregations throughout other parts of the world
        following herein.’ Oxf. Transl. He speaks in the same
        passage of the behaviour of the people: ‘The devout people
        kept watch in the Church, ready to die with their Bishop
        Thy servant.’ He also dwells on the effect produced
        on himself, these events happening shortly before his
        conversion. ‘How did I weep in Thy Hymns and Canticles,
        touched to the quick by the voice of Thy sweet-attuned
        Church! The voices flowed into mine ears, and the Truth
        distilled into mine heart, whence the affections of my
        devotion overflowed, and tears ran down, and happy was
        I therein.’ Ib. ix. 6. It is quite possible that some of
        the twelve Hymns, acknowledged by the Benedictine Editors
        as genuine, were then first sung. Among them are the
        well-known ‘Aeterna Christi munera,’ ‘Aeterne rerum
        Conditor,’ ‘Deus Creator omnium,’ and others, whose strains
        are now familiar in English versions.
