# Letter LXXXIV

>  A BRIEF letter of assent and approval.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO CYNEGIUS
```

1\. HOW ingenuous is the modesty with which you have commended yourself,
in that you have consulted me concerning a matter which you did not
approve, out of deference to your father that you might not injure
piety, feeling safe that no reply could be made by me which was
unbeseeming holy relationships.

2\. But I have willingly taken upon me your burdens, and have reconciled,
I hope, the niece to her uncle. Truly I am ignorant with what view he
desired that she should become his daughter-in-law, changing his own
character of uncle for that of father-in-law. I need not add more, lest
this also should be a cause of confusion.

Farewell my son, and love us, for we also love you.
