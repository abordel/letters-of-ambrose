```{centered} TO MARCELLINA
```

1\. IN nearly all your letters you inquire anxiously about the Church;
hear then what is going on. The day after I received the letter in
which you told me how you had been troubled in your dreams, a heavy
weight of troubles began to assail me. It was not now the Portian
Basilica, that is the one without the walls, which was demanded, but
the new Basilica, that is, one within the walls, which is larger in
size.

2\. In the first place some chief men[^100], counsellors of state,
appealed to me to give up the Basilica, and restrain the people from
raising any commotion. I replied as a matter of course, that a Bishop
could not give up God’s house.

3\. On the following day the people expressed their approval in the
Church, and the Præfect[^101] also came thither, and began to urge us
to yield up at least the Portian Basilica. The people were clamorous
against this, whereupon he departed, saying, that he would report
matters to the Emperor.

4\. On the following day, which was the Lord’s day, having dismissed
the catechumens after the lessons and sermon, I was explaining the
Creed to some candidates for Baptism in the Baptistery of the Church.
There the news was reported to me that, on learning that officials[^102]
had been sent from the palace to the Portian Basilica, and were putting
up the Imperial hangings[^103], many of the people were proceeding
thither. I however continued my ministrations, and began to celebrate
the Eucharist[^104].

5\. While I was offering, tidings were brought me that the populace had
seized upon one Castulus, whom the Arians called a priest. While making
the oblation I began to weep bitterly and to beseech God’s aid that no
blood might be shed in the Church’s quarrel; or if so, that it might
be my own, and that not for my people only, but even for the ungodly
themselves. But, to be brief, I sent some presbyters and deacons, and
rescued the man.

6\. The severest penalties were immediately decreed; first upon the
whole body of merchants. And thus, during the sacred period of the last
Week, wherein the debtor was wont to be loosed from his bonds, chains
are placed on innocent men’s necks, and two hundred pounds’ weight of
gold is demanded within three days. They reply they will willingly give
as much, or twice as much again, so that they may not violate their
faith. The prisons too were filled with tradesmen.

7\. All the Officials of the palace, the Recorders, the Proctors, the
Apparitors of the several Courts, on the pretext of its being unlawful
for them to be present at seditious assemblies, were commanded to keep
at home, severe threats were held out against men of high rank in case
the Basilica was not delivered up. The persecution raged, and had an
opening been afforded, they seemed likely to break out into every kind
of outrage.

8\. I myself had an interview with the Counts and Tribunes, who urged me
to give up the Basilica without delay, declaring that the Emperor was
acting on his rights, inasmuch as he had supreme power over all things.
I replied that if he required of me what was my own, my estate, my
money, or the like, I would not refuse it, although all my property
really belonged to the poor, but that sacred things were not subject to
the power of the Emperor. ‘If my patrimony be required,’ I said, ‘take
it; if my person, here it is. Will you drag me away to prison, or to
death? I will go with pleasure. I will not entrench myself by gathering
a multitude round me, I will not lay hold of the Altar and beg for my
life; rather will I offer myself to death for the Altar.’

9\. In fact my mind was shaken with fear when I found that armed men
had been sent to occupy the Basilica, I was seized with dread lest in
protecting the Church, blood might be shed which would tend to bring
destruction on the whole city. I prayed that if so great a city or
even all Italy were to perish I might not survive. I shrank from the
odium of shedding blood, and I offered my own throat to the knife. Some
officers of the Goths[^105] were present; I addressed them, saying, ‘Is
it for this that you have become citizens of Rome, to shew yourselves
disturbers of the public peace? Whither will you go, if everything here
is destroyed?’

10\. I was called upon to calm the people. I replied that it was in
my power not to excite them, that it was in God’s Hand to pacify them.
That if I was considered the instigator, I ought to be punished, that
I ought to be banished into whatever desert places of the earth they
chose. Having said this, they departed, and I spent the whole day in
the old Church. Thence I returned home to sleep; that if any man wished
to arrest me, he might find me prepared.

11\. When, before dawn, I passed out over the threshold, I found the
Basilica surrounded and occupied by soldiers. And it was said that they
had intimated to the Emperor that he was at liberty to go to Church if
he wished it, that they would be ready to attend him if he were going
to the assembly of the Catholics; otherwise that they would go to the
assembly which Ambrose had convened.

12\. Not a single Arian dared come out, for there were none among the
citizens, only a few of the royal household, and some of the Goths,
who, as of old they made their waggon their home, so now make the
Church their waggon. Wherever that woman goes, she carries with her all
those of her own communion.

13\. The groans of the people gave me notice that the Basilica was
surrounded; but while the lessons are being read word is brought me
that the New Basilica also is full of people, that the crowd seemed
greater than when all were at liberty, that they were calling for a
Reader. To be brief, the soldiers themselves, who were found to have
occupied the Basilica, being informed of my directions that the people
should abstain from communion with them, began to come to our assembly.
At the sight of them the minds of the women are agitated, one of them
rushes forth. But the soldiers themselves exclaimed that they had come
to pray not to fight. The people raised a cry. In the most modest, most
resolute, most faithful manner they entreated that I would go to that
Basilica. In that Basilica also the people were reported to desire my
presence.

**Ps. xvii. 7.**
```

14\. Then I began the following discourse: Ye have heard, my sons, the
lesson from the book of Job, which according to the usual service of
the season, is now in course. By use the devil knew that this book was
to be declared, already all the power of his temptations is laid open
and betrayed, and therefore he exerted himself to-day with greater
violence. But thanks be to our God Who hath so confirmed you in faith
and patience. I went up into the pulpit to admire Job, I found I had
all of you to admire as Jobs. Job lives again in each of you, in each
the patience and virtue of that saint is reflected. For what more
opportune could be said by Christian men than that which the Holy
Spirit hath spoken in you this day? ‘We petition your Majesty, we
use no force, we feel no fear, but we petition.’ This is what becomes
Christians, to desire peace and quiet fear, and still not to let the
steadfastness of faith and truth be shaken even by peril of death. For
the Lord is our Guide, _Who will save those who hope in Him_.

15\. But let us come to the lessons set before us. Ye see that power
of temptation is given to the devil to prove the good. The wicked one
envies our progress in good, he tempts us in various ways. He tempted
holy Job in his patrimony, he tempted him in his sons, he tempted him
by bodily pains. The stronger is tempted in his own person, the weaker
in that of others. Me too he would fain have despoiled of the riches
which I possess in you, and he desired to waste this patrimony of
your tranquillity. Yourselves also he desired to snatch from me, my
good children for whom I daily offer sacrifice; you he endeavoured
to involve in the ruins of the public confusion. Already then I have
incurred two kinds of temptation. And perhaps the Lord, knowing my
weakness, hath not yet given him power over my body: though I myself
desire it, though I offer it, He perhaps still judges me unequal to
this contest, and exercises me by diverse labours. Even Job himself did
not begin with this contest, but was perfected by it.

```{margin}
**Job ii. 9.**
```

16\. But Job was tempted by the accumulated tidings of evil, he was
tempted by his wife who said, _Curse God, and die_. Ye behold how many
things are suddenly stirred up against us, the Goths, the troops, the
heathen, the fine of the tradesmen, the punishment of the saints. Ye
observe what is commanded, when it is said ‘Deliver up the Basilica;’
_Curse God, and die_. But here it is not only ‘Speak against God,’ but
also ‘Act against God.’ The command is, ‘Betray the altars of God.’

```{margin}
**ib. 10.**

**Gen. iii. 9.**
```

17\. So then we are pressed by the Imperial mandates, but we are
strengthened by the words of Scripture, which answered, _Thou speakest
as one of the foolish women speaketh_. Not slight therefore is that
temptation, for temptations which come through the agency of women
we know to be more severe. Lastly, Adam also was betrayed by Eve,
and thereby it came to pass that he betrayed the Divine commandments.
Becoming aware of this error, and his guilty conscience accusing him,
he desired to hide himself, but could not; wherefore God says to him,
_Adam where art thou?_ that is, what wert thou before? where hast thou
now begun to be? where did I place thee? whither hast thou fallen? thou
ownest thyself naked, because thou hast lost the garments of a good
faith. The things wherewith thou desirest to clothe thyself are leaves.
Thou hast cast aside the fruit, thou desirest to lie hid under the
leaves of the tree, but thou art betrayed. For one woman’s sake thou
hast chosen to depart from thy God, therefore thou fliest from Him when
thou soughtest to see. Thou hast chosen to hide thyself with one woman,
to leave the mirror of the world, the abode of Paradise, the Grace of
Christ.

18\. Why need I add that Elijah also was cruelly persecuted by Jezebel?
that Herodias caused John the Baptist to be put to death? Each man
seems to suffer from this or that woman; for me, in proportion as
my merits are less, my trials are heavier. My strength is weaker,
but I have more danger. Women succeed each other, their hatreds are
interchanged, their falsehoods are varied, the elders are gathered
together, the plea of wrong to the Emperor is put forward. What
explanation is there then of such grievous temptation to such a worm
as I am, but that it is not me but the Church that they persecute.

**S. Matt. xxii. 21.**

**S. Matt. xiv. 4.**
```

19\. At length came the command, ‘Deliver up the Basilica;’ I reply, ‘It
is not lawful for us to deliver it up, nor for your Majesty to receive
it. By no law can you violate the house of a private man, and do you
think that the house of God may be taken away? It is asserted that
all things are lawful to the Emperor, that all things are his. But do
not burden your conscience with the thought that you have any right as
Emperor over sacred things. Exalt not yourself, but if you would reign
the longer, be subject to God. It is written, _God’s to God and Cæsar’s
to Cæsar_. The palace is the Emperor’s, the Churches are the Bishop’s.
To you is committed jurisdiction over public not over sacred buildings.’
Again the Emperor is said to have issued his command, ‘I also ought
to have one Basilica;’ I answered ‘_It is not lawful for thee to have
her_. What hast thou to do with an adultress who is not bound with
Christ in lawful wedlock?’

```{margin}
**Ps. lxxix. 1.**
```

20\. While I was engaged with this subject, it was reported to me that
the Imperial hangings were taken down, the Church filled with people,
and that my presence was required; straightway I turned my discourse to
this, saying, How deep and profound are the oracles of the Holy Spirit!
Remember, brethren, what was read at matins and how we responded with
deep grief of mind, _O God the heathen are come into Thine inheritance_.
And truly the heathen came, nay, even more than the heathen, for the
Goths came and men of divers nations, they came armed with weapons,
and surrounded and seized the Basilica. Ignorant of Thy Greatness we
grieved for this, but our ignorance was mistaken.

```{margin}
**Ps. lxxvi. 2, 3.**

**Ps. xxx. 9.**

**Ps. xxx. 11, 12.**
```

21\. The heathen came, but truly _into Thine inheritance_ they came, for
they who came as heathen were made Christians. They who came to invade
Thine inheritance, were made coheirs of God; those whom I accounted
enemies are become my defenders; I have as comrades those whom I
esteemed adversaries. Thus has that been fulfilled which the prophet
David spake of the Lord Jesus, that _His Dwelling is in peace[^106],
there brake He the horns of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the
battle_. For whose office, whose work is this but Thine, Lord Jesus?
Thou sawest armed men coming to Thy temple, on the one hand the people
groaning and collecting in a crowd that they might not seem to give up
the Basilica, on the other hand the soldiers commanded to use force.
Death was before my eyes, lest in the midst of all this madness should
break out into licence. But Thou, O Lord plantedst Thyself in the midst,
and madest the twain one. Thou restrainedst the soldiers, saying, If
ye run to arms, if they who are within My temple are disturbed, _What
profit is there in My blood?_ All thanks therefore be to Thee, O Christ.
It was not an enemy, not a messenger but _Thou O Lord hast delivered
Thy people, Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness_.

22\. Thus I spoke, wondering that the Emperor’s mind could be softened
by the zeal of the soldiers, by the entreaties of the Counts, by the
prayers of the people. Meanwhile I am informed that a Secretary was
come with the mandate. I retired a little, and he notified to me the
mandate. ‘What has been your design,’ says he, ‘in acting against the
Emperor’s orders?’ I replied, ‘What has been ordered I know not, nor am
I aware what is alleged to have been wrongly done.’ He says, ‘Why have
you sent presbyters to the Basilica? If you are a tyrant I would fain
know it, that I may know how to arm myself against you.’ I replied by
saying that I had done nothing which assumed too much for the Church,
but when I heard it was filled with soldiers, I only uttered deeper
groans, and though many exhorted me to proceed thither, I replied,
‘I cannot give up the Basilica, yet I must not fight.’ That afterwards,
when I was told that the Imperial hangings were removed, and that the
people required me to go thither, I had directed the presbyters to do
so, but that I was unwilling to go myself, saying, ‘I trust in Christ
that the Emperor himself will espouse our cause.’

```{margin}
**2 Cor. xii. 10.**
```

23\. If this seems like domineering, I grant indeed that I have arms,
but only in the name of Christ; I have the power of offering up my
body. Why, I asked, did he delay to strike if he considered my power
unlawful? By ancient right Priests have conferred sovereignty, never
assumed it, and it is a common saying that Emperors have coveted the
Priesthood more often than Priests sovereignty. Christ fled that He
might not be made a king. We have a power of our own. The power of
a Priest is his weakness; _When I am weak_, it is said, _then am
I strong_. But let him against whom God has raised up no adversary
beware lest he raise up a tyrant for himself. Maximus did not say that
I domineered over Valentinian, though he complains that my embassage
prevented his passing over into Italy. I added, that priests were never
usurpers, but that they had often suffered from usurpers.

24\. The whole of that day was past in this affliction; meanwhile the
boys tore in derision the Imperial hangings. I could not return home,
because the Church was surrounded by a guard of soldiers. We recited
the Psalms with our brethren in the little Basilica belonging to the
Church.

```{margin}
**Jonah iv. 9.**
```

25\. On the following day, the book of Jonah was read in due course,
after which, I began this discourse; We have read a book, my brethren,
wherein it is foretold that sinners shall return again to repentance.
They are accepted on this footing, that their present state is
considered an earnest of the future. I added that this just man was
even willing to incur blame, rather than behold or denounce destruction
on the city; and, since that prophecy was mournful, that he was also
grieved because the gourd had withered; that God had said to the
prophet, _Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?_ and Jonah had answered,
_I am greatly angry_. Then the Lord said, if the withering of the gourd
was a grief to him, how much more ought he to care for the salvation
of so many souls; and therefore that He had suspended the destruction
which had been prepared for the whole city.

```{margin}
**Ib. 7.**
```

26\. Immediate tidings are brought to me that the Emperor had commanded
the soldiers to retire from the Church; and that the fine which had
been imposed on the merchants on their condemnation should be restored.
What joy then prevailed among the whole people, what applause, what
congratulations! Now it was the day whereon the Lord delivered Himself
up for us, the day whereon there is a relaxation of penance in the
Church. The soldiers eagerly brought the tidings, running in to the
altars, and giving the kiss, the emblem of peace. Then I perceived that
God had smitten _the worm which came when the morning rose_, that the
whole city might be preserved.

27\. These are the past events, and would that they were terminated, but
the excited words of the Emperor show that heavier trials are awaiting
us. I am called a tyrant, and even more than tyrant. For when the
Counts besought the Emperor to go to the Church, and said that they did
so at the request of the soldiers, he replied, ‘You would deliver me
up to chains, if Ambrose bade you.’ I leave you to judge what awaits us
after these words; all shuddered at hearing them, but there are those
about him who exasperate him.

28\. Lastly Calligonus the Grand Chamberlain[^107] ventured to address
himself specially to me. ‘Do you, while I live, despise Valentinian?
I will have your head.’ I replied, ‘May God grant you to fulfil your
threat: I shall suffer as becomes a Bishop, you will act as befits an
eunuch.’ May God indeed turn them aside from the Church; may all their
weapons be directed against me, may they satiate their thirst in my
blood!

[^100]: The expression ‘principes virtutum’ seems to be a phrase
    from the Old Testament. In the Vulgate we find ‘rex
    virtutum’ Ps. lxvii, (lxviii. E.V.) 13, where the E.V.
    has ‘kings of armies,’ and in Judith xiv. 17 (19 E.V.)
    ‘Quod quum audissent principes virtutis Assyriorum,’ and
    in 1 Macc. v. 56. ‘Azarias princeps virtutis.’ The ‘comites
    consistoriani’ formed a sort of cabinet (consistorium) or
    privy council to the Emperor. The Benedictine Editors take
    ‘principes virtutum’ as meaning the Magistri militum, but
    the absence of any conjunction is against this.

[^101]: This must mean the Præfectus prætorio Italiæ, one of
    the four great Viceroys, under whom the Dioceses of the
    Empire were placed. He was supreme over all Italy, and the
    countries north of it to the Danube, and the western part
    of the north of Africa. He had under him three Dioceses,
    containing thirty Provinces.

[^102]: The title given them is ‘Decani.’ They seem to have been
    something like the lictors of the great officers of state
    under the republic.

[^103]: These ‘vela’ or hangings were a token that the building
    was claimed for the ‘fiscus,’ or private property of
    the Emperor. Gibbon in his grand way says, ‘the splendid
    canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the
    customary manner,’ but, as is noticed by the writer of the
    Life of S. Ambrose in Dict. of Christian Biog. it is clear
    from the sequel of the narrative (see § 20) that they were
    outside, not inside the Church.

[^104]: The words in the original are ‘missam facere.’ Prof.
    Bright in his History notes that this is ‘the earliest
    instance, apparently, of this term being used for the
    Eucharistic service.’

[^105]: ‘The introduction of barbarians into the Roman armies
    became every day more universal, more necessary, and more
    fatal. The most daring of the Scythians, of the Goths, and
    of the Germans, were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries
    of their respective nations, but in the legions themselves,
    and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops.’
    (Gibbon, ch. xvii.) The Goths were Arians. It was much
    about this time that Ulfilas, the apostle of the Goths,
    made his famous translation of the Bible into Gothic. See
    Bright’s Hist. of the Church p. 157.

[^106]: This is the Vulgate rendering of ‘_At Salem is His
    Tabernacle_.’

[^107]: On the high rank and great influence of the Præpositus
    cubiculi, or Grand Chamberlain, see Gibbon ch. xvii.
    They ranked with the Præfecti prætorio and other highest
    officers of state as Illustres. See note on Lett. xvii. § 1.
