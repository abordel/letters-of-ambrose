# Letter III
**A.D. 380**

> THIS graceful little letter, written in a tone of playful
> affectionateness, is addressed to Felix, who was, as the next
> letter shews, Bishop of Comum. It tells its own story.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO FELIX
```

1\. I HAVE received your present of mushrooms; they were of an
extraordinary size, so large as to excite admiration. I did not like
to keep them hidden, as the saying is, in my bosom, but preferred
shewing them to others also. Therefore I gave part to my friends, part
I reserved for myself.

2\. An agreeable present, but not of weight enough to repress
my just complaint against you for never visiting one who has so
long loved you. And take heed lest you hereafter have to bear yet
heavier fungus-growths[^7] of sorrow; for such things have a double
signification; sent as gifts they are agreeable, in the body or the
mind they are irksome. Prevail with yourself to cause me less sorrow
by your absence, for my longing for you is the cause of my distress:
make yourself, if you can, less necessary to me.

3\. I have made my statement, proved my case. I am forced to assail
you with that expression; no ordinary weapon, but one which will hit
home[^8]. You certainly shewed alarm; but see now that I am not so much
grieved but that I can be playful about it. Hereafter however you must
not excuse yourself, though your present excuse is to be a profitable
one to me. Yet it were an ill judgment of you, and of me no better, to
suppose that your absence is to be compensated by presents, or that I
am to be bought off by them. Farewell: love me, as I do you.

[^7]: tubera

[^8]: Amentata illa non manipularis sententia. Ed. Ben. refers
    to Junius, Adagiorum Centuriae 3, 10, who says ‘Amentatam
    sententiam dixit D. Ambrosius pro validâ et haud vulgari
    firmisque argumentis roboratâ. Est autem amentum lori
    genus quo hasta praeligata validius certiusque libratur
    evibraturque: hinc amentata sententia ea est quæ neutiquam
    trivialis est et pedanea, cujusmodi manipularis vocatur,
    velut a gregario milite profecta, sed eximia et artificio
    vallata.’ He quotes two passages from Cicero, De Orat.
    1 57, 242. Brut. 78. 271, in both which places he uses
    ‘amentatæ hastæ’ of arguments, and also Tertull. adv. Marc.
    iv. 33 where he says that our Lord amentavit [Phariseis]
    hanc sententiam, non potestis Deo servire et mammonæ,
    where it plainly means, ‘gave them this home-thrust.’
