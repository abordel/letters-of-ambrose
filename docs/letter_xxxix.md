```{centered} AMBROSE TO FAUSTINUS, GREETING
```

1\. I WAS well aware that you would grieve with bitter grief for the
death of your sister: still you should not go into banishment, but
rather give yourself back to us, for although mourners are little
inclined to receive consolation, it is sometimes necessary for them.
But you have fled to the recesses of the mountains, and made your
dwelling in the caves of wild beasts, laying aside all customary human
converse and, what is worse, the use of your own reason.

2\. Is it in accordance with your esteem for your sister, that human
nature, which ought to be much regarded by you for producing a woman
so excellent, should on her account be of less value in your eyes? In
quitting this life it doubtless was a consolation to her to believe
that she left you behind her as a parent to your nephews, a guardian of
their tender years, a succour to their destitution; but you so utterly
withhold yourself both from your nephews and from us, that we do not
reap any benefit from what she thus found a ground of consolation.
These dear pledges invite you not to grieve, but to comfort them, that
in seeing you they may believe their mother to be still alive. In you
then let them recognize her; in you let them enjoy her presence, in you
think that she still survives to them.

3\. But you grieve that she has been lately cut off in the flower of
her age. This however is the common fate not only of men, but of states
and countries themselves. Coming from Bononia[^192] you left behind you
Claterna, Bononia itself, Matina, Rhegium; Brixillum was on your right,
in front of you Placentia, by its very name still recalling its ancient
lustre, on the left you saw with pity the wastes of the Apennines,
you surveyed the fortresses of these once flourishing tribes, and
remembered them with sorrowful affection. Do not then the carcases of
so many half-ruined cities, and states stretched on their bier beneath
your eyes, do not these remind you that the decease of one woman, holy
and excellent as she was, is much less deplorable especially as these
are for ever laid prostrate and destroyed, but she though removed from
us for a while is passing a more blessed life elsewhere?

4\. Wherefore I deem that you ought not so much to deplore her, as
to offer for her your prayers; make her not sorrowful by your tears,
rather commend her soul to God by oblations.

5\. Perhaps however you will declare yourself to be secure of her merits
and faith, you cannot endure the feeling of regret at seeing her no
longer after the flesh, which is to you a better grief. And does not
the Apostolic saying move you that _henceforth we know no man after
the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
henceforth know we Him no more_. For our flesh cannot be perpetual and
lasting, it must needs die that it may rise again, it must be dissolved
that it may rest, and sin come to an end. We too have known many
according to the flesh, but now we know them no more. _We have known
the Lord Jesus_, says the Apostle, _after the flesh, yet now henceforth
know we Him no more_. For now He has put off the coil of the body, and
is not seen in fashion as a Man, but has died for all and all are dead
in Him, to the intent that being renewed by Him and quickened in the
Spirit they may no longer live to themselves but to Christ. Wherefore
the same Apostle also says elsewhere, _I live, yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me_.

6\. And well indeed was it that he who had before known Christ after the
flesh, who had before persecuted and oppressed with bitter hatred the
disciples of the Man, and the attendants on His bodily presence, but
who now recognized His invisible workings, discerning not His bodily
presence but His power,――well indeed was it that he became the teacher
of the Gentiles, and began to instruct and prepare the worshippers of
His Divinity to become preachers of the Gospel. Wherefore he added,
_if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature_, that is, he that is
perfect in Christ is a new creature, for all flesh is imperfect. And
the Lord saith, _My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that
he also is flesh_. No carnal man then is in Christ, but _if any man be
in Christ he is a new creature_, formed by newness not of nature but of
grace. These _old things_ which are according to the flesh _have past
away, all things are made new_. And what are they but the things which
_the scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven_ knows, _like unto
that householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and
old_; neither old things without new, nor new things without old? Thus
too the Church saith, _things new and old have I laid up for Thee_. For
old things, that is, the hidden mysteries of the Law are passed away,
all things are made new in Christ.

7\. This is the new creature of which the Apostle writing to the
Galatians saith, _For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature_, already our flesh now
renewed flourishes, and having before borne the thorns of inveterate
sin hath now found the fruit of grace. Why then need we grieve, if we
can now say to the soul, _thy youth is renewed like the eagles_? And
why should we bewail the dead, now that by our Lord Jesus _the world
has been reconciled to the Father_? Since then we hold the benefits
which Christ hath given, we are to you as well as to all ambassadors in
Christ’s stead, that you may know His Gift to be irrevocable, that you
may believe what you always have believed, and not bring your opinion
into discredit by too much sorrow. For the Lord Jesus was made sin that
He might _take away the sin of the world_, and we all might be _made
the righteousness of God in Him_; now no longer subject to the penalty
of sin, but sure of the reward of righteousness.

Farewell; love me, for I love you.
