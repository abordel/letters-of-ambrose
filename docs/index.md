# The Letters of St. Ambrose
*by St. Ambrose of Milan in the year of our Lord 397*

A collection of writings attributed to St. Ambrose of Milan.
Among his correspondents include his friends, emperors, bishops of the early church,
and his sister Marcellina. This work was originally translated by the Benedictines
in Britain and we owe much to their hard work. Of particular
interest are the proceedings in {doc}`The Council of Aquiliea<council_of_aquileia>` where
the trial against the Arians Palladius and Secundianus is documented.
