# Letter XIII
**A.D. 382**

> IN the year following the Council of Aquileia, a Council of
> the Bishops of the civil Diocese of Italy appears to have been
> held, over which S. Ambrose presided. It appears to have dealt
> principally with the questions at issue between the East and
> West. This letter was written by S. Ambrose in the name of the
> Council, after the end of its session (‘in concilio nuper,’ § 3),
> to Theodosius. The Bishops complain of the election of Flavian
> to succeed Meletius at Antioch, contrary to the compromise which
> they urged in the last letter, and maintain Maximus’ claim to
> the see of Constantinople against Nectarius, urging again the
> necessity of a General Council of both East and West, to settle
> finally all the questions in dispute between them, and suggest
> that it should be held at Rome.

```{centered} TO THE MOST BLESSED EMPEROR AND MOST GRACIOUS PRINCE THEODOSIUS, AMBROSE AND THE OTHER BISHOPS OF ITALY
```

1\. WE knew indeed that your holy mind was devoted to God in pure and
sincere faith, but your Majesty has loaded us with fresh benefits in
restoring the Catholics to the Churches. And I would that you could
have restored the Catholics themselves to their ancient reverence,
that they would innovate in nothing against the prescription of our
ancestors, and not be hasty either to rescind what they ought to
maintain nor to maintain what they ought to rescind. Therefore we sigh,
your Majesty, perhaps with too much grief, but not without sufficient
reason, that it has proved easier to get the heretics expelled than to
establish concord among the Catholics. For the extent of the confusion
that has lately taken place is beyond expression.

2\. We wrote to you not long ago, that since the city of Antioch
had two Bishops, Paulinus and Meletius, both of whom we regarded as
true to the faith, they should either agree with each other in peace
and concord, preserving Ecclesiastical order, or at least, if one of
them died before the other, no one should be put into the place of the
deceased while the other lived. But now on the death of Meletius, while
Paulinus is still alive, whom fellowship derived from our predecessors
uninterruptedly testifies to have remained in our Communion, another
person is said to have been not so much supplied, as super-added, into
the place of Meletius, contrary to right and to Ecclesiastical order.

3\. And this is alleged to have taken place by the consent and advice
of Nectarius[^54], the regularity of whose ordination we are not clearly
convinced of. For in a Council lately, when Maximus the Bishop, having
read the letter of Peter a man of holy memory, had shewn that the
communion of the Church of Alexandria remained with him, and had proved
by the clearest testimony, that he was consecrated[^55] by three Bishops
ordaining by mandate within his private house, because the Arians were
at that time in possession of the Basilicas, we had no cause, most
blessed of Princes, to doubt of his episcopacy, when he testified that
he resisted and was forcibly constrained by a majority of the laity and
clergy.

4\. Still that we might not appear to have settled any thing
over-hastily in the absence of the parties, we thought it fit to inform
your Grace by letter, in order that his case might be provided for so
as best to serve the interests of public peace and concord, because
in truth we perceived that Gregory claimed to himself the priesthood
of the Church of Constantinople, by no means in accordance with the
tradition of the Fathers. We therefore in that Synod, attendance at
which appeared to have been prescribed to the Bishops of the whole
world, were of opinion that nothing ought to be decided rashly. So at
that particular time the persons who declined a general Council and who
are said to have had one at Constantinople, where they had ascertained
that Maximus had come hither to plead his cause in the Synod (and this,
even if a Council had not been proclaimed it was competent for him to
do lawfully and according to the customs of our predecessors, as also
Athanasius of holy memory, and since that Peter, brother Bishops of the
Church of Alexandria, and several of the Eastern Bishops have done, so
as to appear to have sought the decision of the Churches of Rome, of
Italy, and of all the West) when, as we said, they saw that he wished
to bring the question to a trial with those who denied his episcopate,
they were surely bound to wait for our opinion upon it[^56]. We do not
claim any special privilege of examining such matters, but we ought to
have had a share in an united decision.

5\. Last of all, it ought to have been decided whether he was to lose
his See, before deciding whether another should receive it, especially
by persons by whom Maximus complained that he was either deserted or
injured. Therefore since Maximus the Bishop has been received into
Communion by those of our fellowship on the ground that it was certain
that he had been ordained by Catholics, we did not see that he ought to
have been excluded from his claim to the Bishopric of Constantinople,
and we thought that his allegation ought to be weighed in the presence
of the parties.

But since we have learned recently that Nectarius has been ordained
at Constantinople, we fear that our communion with the Oriental
regions is broken, especially since Nectarius is said to have been left
immediately without the fellowship of Communion by the very persons by
whom he was ordained.

6\. There is therefore no slight difficulty here. And it is not any
contention about wishes and ambition of our own that makes us anxious,
but we are greatly disturbed by the breaking up and interruption of
communion. Nor do we see any way in which concord can be established
except either by restoring to Constantinople the Bishop who was first
ordained, or at least having a Council of ourselves and of the Eastern
Bishops at Rome, to consider the ordination of both of them.

7\. Nor does it seem unbecoming, your Majesty, that the persons, who
thought the judgement of Acholius, a single Bishop, so well worth
waiting for, that they called him to Constantinople from the regions of
the West, should be obliged to submit to the discussion of the Bishop
of the Church of Rome, and of the Bishops of the neighbourhood and of
Italy. If a question was reserved for a single individual, how much
more should it be reserved for many?

8\. We, however, as it has been suggested to us by the most blessed
Prince, your Brother[^57], that we should write to your Grace’s Majesty,
request that when the communion is one, you would be pleased that the
judgement should be joint and the consent concurrent.

[^54]: In the regard of the question between Nectarius and
    Maximus, the Western Bishops had been deceived by the
    latter. Maximus, called the Cynic because he retained the
    outward garb of a Cynic philosopher after he professed to
    have become a Christian, was irregularly consecrated at
    Constantinople, but was never recognised, and was formally
    pronounced by the Council not to be a true Bishop. He then
    went about trying to stir up other Churches in his favour.
    See Prof. Bright’s Hist. of the Church, pp. 160–166.

    Nectarius was elected after the resignation of Gregory
    Nazianzen, during the Council of Constantinople. He, like
    S. Ambrose, was unbaptized and held a high civil office at
    the time of his election.

[^55]: This is translated from an ingenious and probable
    conjecture of Valesius.

[^56]: The text through this long sentence is confused and
    ungrammatical, but it conveys the general sense expressed
    in the translation with tolerable clearness.

[^57]: i. e. Gratian.
