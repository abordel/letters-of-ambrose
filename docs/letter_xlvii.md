# Letter XLVII
**A.D. 390**

> THIS brief letter was sent with a book which Sabinus had asked
> for. It is a friendly invitation to a regular correspondence, as
> bringing friends together in spirit who are severed in body.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO SABINUS
```

1\. I HAVE transmitted the volume you asked for, written more clearly
and neatly than the one which I had previously sent, in order that by
the facility of its perusal your judgment of it might be unimpeded. For
the original copy was written not for appearance, but for use, for I
do not always employ a scribe, especially at night, at which time I am
unwilling to be a trouble and a burthen to others, and further, because
the words I am then dictating flow on with a kind of impetuosity, and
in a rapid stream.

```{margin}
**Ps. xlv. 2.**
```

2\. But as I am desirous to select with precision the words which my
old age employs in its familiar intercourse, and to proceed with a slow
step, I think the use of my own hands in writing befits me better; that
I may seem rather to conceal my words than lustily give vent to them;
and may not have to blush at the presence of him who is writing for me,
but, having no one in the secret of my words, may weigh what I write
with eye as well as with ears. For, in the words of Scripture, the
tongue is swifter than the hand; _My tongue is the pen of a ready
writer_.

```{margin}
**Gal. vi. 11.**
```

3\. And though you may perhaps say that the swiftness is here attributed
to the writer, the meaning will nevertheless not escape you that it is
only the swiftness of a ready writer which can take down the words of
the prophetic tongue. The Apostle Paul also wrote with his own hand, as
he says himself, _I have written unto you with mine own hand_. He did
it to show honour, we do it from bashfulness.

4\. But while your judgement of my book is still in suspense, let us
entertain each other by letters; the advantage whereof is that although
severed from each other by distance of space we may be united in
affection; for by this means the absent have the image of each otherâ€™s
presence reflected back upon them, and conversation by writing unites
the severed. By this means also we interchange thoughts with our friend,
and transpose our mind into his.

5\. Now if, according to your admonition, there is any savour of ancient
writings in our letters, not only do our minds seem to be united by
this progress in true doctrine, but also the form and fashion of a more
intimate converse seems to be set forth, in that the discussion which
is thus entered upon by mutual inquiry and reply appears to place in
presence of each other those friends who in this manner challenge and
engage one another.

```{margin}
**1 Cor. v. 3.**
```

6\. And why need I produce the example of our ancestors, who by their
letters have instilled faith into the minds of the people, and have
written to whole nations together, and have shewn themselves to be
present although writing from a distance, according to the words of the
Apostle, that he was _absent in body, but present in spirit_, not only
in writing but also in judging. Again, he condemned them while absent
by epistle, and also absolved them by epistle; for the epistle of Paul
was a certain image of his presence and form of his work.

```{margin}
**2 Cor. x. 10.**

**Ib. 11.**
```

7\. For the epistles of the Apostles were not, like those of others,
_weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence weak, and his speech
contemptible_, but his letter was of that kind that such as was the
substance of his work such also was the form of his precept; for
_such_, says he, _as we are in word by letters when absent, such will
we be also in deed when we are present_. He imprinted the image of his
presence on his letters, he declared its fruit and testimony in his
work.

Farewell; love me, as indeed you do, for I love you.
