```{centered} TO THE LADY HIS SISTER WHOM HE LOVES MORE THAN HIS LIFE AND EYES AMBROSE HER BROTHER SENDS GREETING
```

1\. AS I am wont to keep your holiness informed of all that goes on
here in your absence, I would have you know that we have found the
bodies of some holy martyrs. After the consecration of a Church[^121],
many began to interrupt me crying with one voice; Consecrate this as
you did the Roman Basilica. ‘I will do so,’ I replied, ‘if I find any
relics of Martyrs:’ and immediately my heart burned within me as if
prophetically.

2\. In short the Lord lent us aid[^122], though even the very clergy
were alarmed. I caused the ground to be opened before the rails of the
Church of S.S. Felix and Nabor. I found the suitable tokens; and when
some persons were brought for us to lay our hands upon, the power of
the holy martyrs became so manifest that before I began to speak, one
of them, a woman[^123], was seized[^124] by an evil spirit and thrown
down upon the ground in the place where the martyrs lay. We found two
men of stupendous size, such as belonged to ancient days. All their
bones were entire, and there was much blood. The people flocked thither
in crowds throughout the whole of those two days. We arranged all the
bones in order, and carried them when evening set in, to the Basilica
of Fausta[^125]; where we kept vigils throughout the night, and some
possessed persons received imposition of hands. The following day we
transferred them to the Basilica which they call Ambrosian. During
their transportation a blind man was healed[^126]. My discourse to
the people was as follows. When I considered in what overflowing and
unprecedented numbers you were met together, and thought on the gifts
of Divine Grace which shone forth in the holy Martyrs, I felt myself,
I confess, unequal to this task, and thought it impossible that I could
find language to express that which we can hardly conceive in mind
or endure with our eyes. But when the reading of the regular Lessons
of Holy Scripture began, the Holy Spirit, Who spoke by the Prophets,
granted us grace to speak somewhat worthy of this great and expectant
concourse, and of the merits of the holy Martyrs.

**Ps. xix. 1.**
```

4\. _The heavens_, the Psalmist says, _declare the glory of God_.
On reading this Psalm the thought arises that it is not so much the
material elements as the heavenly merits that seem to offer praise
worthy of God. But by the coincidence of the Lesson being read to-day
it is made plain what are the _heavens_ which _tell of the glory of
God_. Behold on my right hand and on my left the holy relics, behold
men of heavenly conversation, behold the trophies of a lofty mind.
These are the _heavens_ which _declare the glory of God_; these are
_the works of His hands_ which _are told by the firmament_. For it
was not worldly snares, but the favour of the Divine operation, which
raised them to the firmament of the most sacred Passion, and long
beforehand by the evidence of their conversation and virtues bore this
testimony of them, that they remained stedfast against the slippery
wiles of this world.

```

5\. Paul was an heaven, when he says, _Our conversation is in heaven_.
James and John were heavens; they are called _sons of thunder_; and
therefore being as it were, an heaven, John saw _the Word with God_.
The Lord Jesus Christ Himself was an heaven of perpetual light, when He
told forth the glory of God, that glory which no man had before beheld.
And therefore He said, _No man hath seen God at any time, but the
Only-Begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
Him_. Moreover, if you look for the handiwork of God, hear what Job
says, _The Spirit of God hath made me_. And so, strengthened against
the temptations of the devil, he preserved his steps stedfast and
without stumbling. But let us proceed to what follows.

```{margin}
**Ps. xix. 2.**
```

6\. _Day unto day_, the Psalm says, _uttereth speech_. These are the
true _days_, which no shades of night obscure; these are the true
_days_, full of light and eternal radiance, who have _uttered the word_
of God not by any mere transient utterance but from their inmost heart,
continuing constant in their confession, persevering in their testimony.

**Ps. cxiii. 5, 6.**

**Ps. cxiii. 7, 8.**

**Ib. 9.**
```

7\. Another Psalm we read saith, _Who is like unto the Lord our God,
that hath His dwelling so high, and yet regardeth the lowly things
that are in heaven and earth_. Truly God hath _regarded the lowly_, Who
hath discovered the relics of the martyrs of His Church as they lay hid
under the unnoted sod, of those whose souls are in heaven, while their
bodies are in the earth, _taking up the simple out of the dust and
lifting the poor out of the mire_, even those whom ye see, _to set them
with the princes of His people_. For whom but the holy martyrs shall
we deem to be _princes of the people_? In their number Protasius and
Gervasius heretofore long unknown are enrolled, they who have caused
the Church of Milan, once _barren_ of martyrs, but now _the mother of
many children_, to exult both in the honors and examples of her own
sufferings?

```{margin}
**1 Cor. xv. 41.**
```

8\. Nor let this be considered alien from the true Faith: _Day unto
day uttereth speech_, soul to soul, life to life, resurrection to
resurrection. _And night unto night uttereth knowledge_, that is, flesh
to flesh, the flesh whose sufferings have declared to all the true
knowledge of faith. Bright and fair nights, full of stars: _For one
star differeth from another star in glory, so also is the resurrection
of the dead_.

9\. But many not improperly call this the resurrection of the martyrs;
whether they have risen for themselves is another question, for us
beyond a doubt they are risen. Ye have heard, nay, yourselves have seen,
many cleansed from evil spirits; many also, after touching with their
hands the garments of the saints, delivered from the infirmities under
which they suffered: ye have seen the miracles of old time renewed,
when through the coming of the Lord Jesus, a fuller Grace descended
upon the earth; ye see many healed by the shadow, as it were, of the
holy bodies. How many napkins are passed to and fro? How many garments
placed on these holy relics, and endowed by the mere contact with the
power of healing are reclaimed by their owners. All think themselves
happy in touching even the outer-most thread, and whoever touches them
will be made whole.

```{margin}
**Ps. xx. 7.**
```

10\. Thanks be to Thee, Lord Jesus, that at this time, when Thy Church
requires greater guardianship, Thou hast raised up for us the spirits
of the holy martyrs. Let all be well aware what kind of champions I
desire, such as are wont to be protectors not assailants. Such are
they, O holy people, whom I have obtained for you, a benefit to all,
and a hurt to none. These are the defenders whom I desire, these are
my soldiers, not the world’s soldiers, but Christ’s. I fear no odium on
account of these; their patronage is safe in proportion to its power.
Nay, I desire their protection for the very men who grudge them to
me. Let them come then and see my body-guard: I deny not that I am
surrounded by such weapons as these; _Some put their trust in chariots
and some in horses, but we will magnify ourselves in the Name of the
Lord our God_.

11\. The Lesson from Holy Scripture relates how Elisha, when surrounded
by the army of the Syrians, told his trembling servant not to fear,
_for they_, said he, _that are for us are more than they which are
against us_; and in order to convince Gehazi of this, he prayed that
his eyes might be opened, and when this was done he saw a countless
host of Angels present with the prophet. And we, though we see them
not, yet are conscious of their presence. Our eyes were held, as long
as the bodies of the saints lay hid in their graves. Now God has opened
our eyes, and we have seen the aids which had so often succoured us.
Before, we saw them not, although we possessed them. And so, as though
the Lord said to our trembling hearts, ‘Behold what great martyrs I
have given you;’ even so _with opened eyes we behold the glory of the
Lord_, which as to the passion of the martyrs is past, as to their
operation is present. We have escaped, my brethren, no light load of
shame; we had patrons and we knew it not. This one thing we have found,
wherein we seem to excel our ancestors; they lost the knowledge of the
holy martyrs, and we have gained it.

12\. These noble relics are dug out of an ignoble sepulchre; these
trophies are displayed in the face of day. The tomb is moist with blood,
the tokens of a triumphant death are displayed, the uninjured relics
are found in their proper place and order, the head separated from the
body. Old men now relate that they have formerly heard the names of
these martyrs, and read their titles. The city which had seized on the
martyrs of other places had lost her own. This is the gift of God, and
yet the favour which the Lord Jesus has conferred in the time of my
episcopate I cannot deny, and since I myself am not counted worthy to
be a martyr, I have gained these martyrs for you.

13\. Bring these victorious victims to the spot where Christ is the
sacrifice. But He, Who suffered for all, upon the Altar, they, who have
been redeemed by His passion, under the Altar. This spot I had destined
for myself, for it is fitting that the priest should rest where he hath
been wont to offer, but I give up the right side to the sacred victims:
that spot was due to the martyrs. Wherefore let us bury the hallowed
relics, placing them in a worthy home, and let us employ the whole day
in faithful devotion.

14\. The people loudly requested that the deposition of the martyrs
should be deferred until the Lord’s Day; but at length I prevailed that
it should take place on the following day. On that day I delivered a
second sermon to the people to the following effect.

```{margin}
**Ps. xix. 2.**
```

15\. Yesterday I discoursed upon the verse, _Day unto day uttereth
speech_, speaking according to my capacity: to-day Holy Scripture
seems to me to have prophecied, not only before, but now. For seeing
that this your devout celebration has continued night and day, the
oracles of prophetic song have declared that these, even yesterday
and to-day, are the days of which it is most opportunely said _day
unto day uttereth speech_, and these the nights to which the saying is
appropriate that _night unto night uttereth knowledge_. For what else
have ye done during these two days but utter the word of God with deep
emotion, and prove yourselves to have the knowledge of faith?

```{margin}
**S. Matt. viii. 29.**
```

16\. This your celebration some, as is their wont, are envious of. And
since their envious minds cannot endure it, they also hate its cause,
and proceed to such a pitch of folly as to deny the merits of the
martyrs, whose power the very devils confess. But this is not strange;
for such is the faithlessness of unbelievers that the confession of the
devil himself is often less intolerable. For the devil said, _Jesus,
Thou Son of the living God, art Thou come to torment us before the
time?_ And yet when the Jews heard this they even then denied the Son
of God. And now ye have heard the devils crying out, and owning to the
martyrs that they cannot bear their tortures, and saying ‘Why are ye
come to torment us so grievously?’ And the Arians say, ‘These are not
martyrs, nor can they torment the devil nor dispossess any one:’ while
yet their own words are evidence of the torments of the evil spirits,
and the benefits of the martyrs are shewn by the recovery of the healed,
and the manifest proof of those that were dispossessed.

17\. They deny that the blind man received his sight, but he denies
not his own cure. He says, ‘I who was blind now see.’ He says, ‘My
blindness has left me;’ he evidences it by the fact. They deny the
benefit, though they cannot deny the fact. The man is well known:
when in health he was employed in public trade, his name is Severus,
a butcher by business. When his affliction befell him he laid down his
employment. He calls as his witnesses those men by whose charities he
was supported; he summons as witnesses of his present visitation the
very men who bore testimony to his blindness. He declares that when he
touched the border of the garment with which the martyrs’ bodies were
clothed, his sight was restored to him.

```{margin}
**S. John ix. 25.**
```

18\. Is not this like what we read in the Gospel? For the power which
we admire proceeds from one and the same Author; nor does it signify
whether it is a work or a gift, seeing that He confers gifts in His
works and works by His gifts. For what He has enabled some themselves
to perform, this in the work of others His Name effects. Thus we read
in the Gospel that the Jews, when they saw that the blind man had
received his sight, required the testimony of his parents. They asked,
‘How has your son received his sight?’ That blind man said, _Whereas I
was blind now I see_, and so too our blind man says, ‘I was blind, and
now I see.’ Enquire of others, if ye believe me not; question strangers,
if you suspect his parents of being in collusion with me. The obstinacy
of these men is more detestable than that of the Jews, for the latter
inquired of the man’s parents to solve their doubts; they secretly
inquire but openly deny, no longer refusing credit to the miracle but
to its Author.

```{margin}
**S. John xiv. 12.**
```

19 and 20. But I would fain ask, what it is they will not believe;
is it that any one can be relieved by the martyrs? But this is not to
believe in Christ, for He hath said, _And greater things than these
shall ye do_. Or only by those martyrs, whose merits have long been
efficacious, and whose bodies have long been discovered? Here I ask
whether it is of myself or of the holy martyrs that they are jealous?
If of me, have I wrought any miracles by my own means, in my own name?
Why then do they envy me that which is not mine? But if of the martyrs
(for if not of me it must be of them they are envious) they show that
their Creed is different from that of the martyrs. For they would not
envy their works unless they deemed the faith which was in them to be
that which they themselves have not. This is that Faith sealed by the
tradition of our ancestors, which the devils themselves cannot deny,
though the Arians do.

21\. We have heard to-day those on whom hands were laid, profess
that no man can be saved who does not believe in the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost: that he was dead and buried who denied the Holy Ghost,
who believed not the Almighty power of the Trinity. This the devil
confesses, but the Arians will not own it. The devil says, Let him who
denies the divinity of the Holy Spirit be tormented as he himself was
tormented by the Martyrs.

```{margin}
**S. Mark i. 24.**

**S. John ix. 29.**
```

22\. What I accept from the devil is not his testimony, but his
confession. He spoke unwillingly, compelled and tortured. That which
wickedness suppressed, force extorted. The devil yields to blows,
but as yet the Arians have not learned to yield. How much have they
suffered, and like Pharaoh, they are hardened by their calamities! The
devil said, as we find it written, _I know Thee Who Thou art, the Son
of the Living God_. The Jews said, _We know not who He is_. Yesterday,
and the preceding night and day the devils said, ‘We know that ye are
martyrs,’ while the Arians said, ‘We know not, we will not understand
nor believe.’ The devils say to the martyrs, ‘Ye are come to destroy
us,’ the Arians say, ‘These torments of the devil are not true torments
but pretended and counterfeit.’ I have heard of many counterfeits, but
no man could ever feign himself a devil. Again, what is the meaning of
the agony we see in them, when the hand is laid on them? What room is
here for fraud and what suspicion of imposture?

```{margin}
**Gen. iv. 10.**
```

23\. But I will not call the words of devils as a testimony to the
martyrs: let the sacred sufferings of the martyrs be established
by their own supernatural acts; judges indeed they have, namely,
those that have been cleansed, witnesses, namely those that have
been dispossessed. Better than that of devils is their voice who came
diseased and are now healed, better is that voice which the martyrs
blood sends forth, for blood has a loud voice which reaches from earth
to heaven. Ye have read those words of God, _Thy brother’s blood crieth
unto Me!_ This blood cries by its purple stains, it cries by its signal
efficacy, it cries by its triumphant suffering.

We have granted your request and have put off till to-day the burial of
the relics which should have taken place yesterday.

[^121]: This is said to be the Church now called ‘S. Ambrose
    the greater.’ The Roman Church is the one called in the
    previous letter the ‘New Basilica,’ and also the Church of
    the Apostles. It was probably called ‘Romana’ from being
    near the Porta Romana.

[^122]: S. Augustine says that it was revealed to him in a dream.

[^123]: These were ἐνεργούμενοι, or persons possessed by evil
    spirits. On them see Bingh. Antiq. iii. 4, 6. The laying
    on of hands was part of the rite of exorcism.

[^124]: The text stands ‘arriperetur urna,’ nor is there any
    variation of MSS. noted. But it seems absolutely necessary
    to read ‘una.’ An ‘urna’ could have nothing to do with
    the matter. It might hold ashes, but surely not the bones
    of two men of marvellous size. The histories founded on
    the letter all tacitly adopt the emendation, and speak of
    ‘a woman among the possessed.’ See Fleury. B. xviii. 46.
    Tillemont in Vit.

[^126]: This is distinctly asserted by S. Augustine in all the
    three passages referred to in the Introduction.
