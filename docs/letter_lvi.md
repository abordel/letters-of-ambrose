# Letter LVI
**A.D. 392**

> A NOTE in p. 71 [Footnote #50] gives a brief outline of
> the schism in the Church of Antioch up to the time of the
> Council of Aquileia, which made some efforts to bring about
> a settlement. Meletius was then succeeded by Flavian, so that
> there still remained two rival Bishops, Flavian and Paulinus.
> Another opportunity for closing the schism came at Paulinus’
> death, at the end of 388 A.D., but so far from allowing the
> wound to be so healed Paulinus on his death-bed consecrated
> Evagrius as his successor in violation of the Canons of Nicæa,
> (Theod. H.E. v. 23) which ‘do not allow a Bishop to appoint
> his successor, but require all the Bishops of the province to
> be summoned to elect, and forbid consecration without at least
> three consecrating Bishops.’ The western Bishops therefore
> continued to press Theodosius to call a Council to deal with
> the matter, which was accordingly assembled at Capua. Flavian,
> though ordered by the Emperor, did not appear, and the
> Council referred the question to the decision of Theophilus
> of Alexandria and the Bishops of Egypt who were not committed
> to either side, and in this letter S. Ambrose replies to
> Theophilus who had written to him that Flavian still refused
> to submit himself to their decision and again appealed to
> the Emperor, and urges him to summon Flavian once more, and
> endeavour to bring the matter to a peaceful issue, advising
> him to consult also Siricius, the Bishop of Rome. He points
> out that both parties rely rather on the weakness of their
> opponent’s case than on the soundness of their own, and
> expresses a hope that an end may be put to the schism, and
> peace restored to the Church. Tillemont, in note 41 on the
> Life of S. Ambrose, discusses the date of the Synod of Capua,
> and fixes it at the end of A.D. 391, chiefly on the ground
> that Theodosius did not return to Constantinople from Milan
> till November of that year, while it must have been held
> before the disturbance in the west occasioned by the revolt of
> Arbogastes and the death of Valentinian, which took place in
> the spring of A.D. 392.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO THEOPHILUS

1\. EVAGRIUS has no good ground for preferring his claim, Flavian has
cause to fear, and therefore avoids the trial. Let our brethren pardon
our just grief, for on account of these men the whole world is agitated,
yet they do not sympathize with our grief. Let them at least patiently
suffer themselves to be censured by those whom they perceive to have
been for so long a time harassed by their obstinacy. For between these
two who would agree upon nothing which appertains to the peace of
Christ, a grievous discord has arisen and spread through the whole
world.

2\. To this shipwreck of pious peace the holy Council of Capua had at
length opened an haven of tranquillity; that communion should be given
to all throughout the East who profess the Catholic faith, and that
the cause of these two men should be referred to the judgment of your
Holiness, and to our brethren and fellow-bishops of Egypt, as assessors.
For we deemed your judgment likely to be true, in that, having embraced
the communion of neither party, it would be inclined by no favour
towards either side.

3\. But while we were hoping that by these most equitable decrees of
the Council a remedy was now provided, and an end put to discord, your
Holiness writes word that our brother Flavian has again had recourse to
the aid of prayers, and to the support of Imperial Rescripts. And thus
the toil of so many Bishops has been spent to no purpose; we must have
recourse once more to the civil tribunals, to the Imperial Rescripts,
once more must they cross the sea, once more, though weak in body,
exchange their own country for a foreign soil, once more must the
Holy Altars be deserted that we may travel to distant lands, once more
crowds of indigent Bishops, whose poverty was before no burthen to them,
but who now need external aid, must suffer want themselves, or at any
rate use for their journey what else had fed the poor.

4\. Meanwhile Flavian, alone exempt, as he fancies, from the laws, does
not come when all others are assembled. The money-lender and debtor
meet each other, these men alone cannot meet: Flavian by his own will
deprives himself of Episcopal fellowship, and will not appear in person
either at the Imperial order, or when cited by his brethren.

5\. Nevertheless, even this cause of offence does not induce me to
consider our brother Evagrius entirely in the right, although he seems
to himself the more defensible either because Flavian avoids him, or
because he thinks his opponent to be in no better case than himself,
each of them relying more on the defects of his opponent’s ordination
than on the validity[^238] of his own. We however would recall them to a
better course, wishing them to be aided rather by the goodness of their
own cause than by the defects of others.

6\. Now since you have stated in your letter that some form may be
devised touching this matter, whereby the discord of our brethren may
be removed; and as the holy Synod has trusted the right of cognizance
to the unanimous judgment of yourself and our other fellow-bishops from
Egypt, it is fitting that you should again summon our brother Flavian,
so that, if he should persist in not choosing to appear, you may then
without prejudice to the decrees of the Council of Nice, and also of
the Synod of Capua, take such measures for the preservation of general
peace as may not destroy what has been built up: _For if I destroy
what I have built, or build again what I destroyed, I make myself a
transgressor_. Let the grace of that peace which has been obtained be
thus preserved by all, and the refusal of either party to appear will
not have the effect of frustrating it.

7\. Moreover we are of opinion that it will be well for you to refer to
our holy brother the Bishop of the Roman Church; for we do not doubt
that what you shall determine he also will approve. For the resolution
that is come to will be useful, and our peace and quiet will be secure,
if such a decree is made by your advice as shall not create discord in
our communion. And thus we also, receiving the series of your decrees,
and assured that the Roman Church has given its undoubting approbation
to what has been done, shall with gladness participate in the result of
this trial.

[^238]: The word ‘bonis’ must certainly here be inserted in the
    text, ‘uterque alienae magis ordinationis vitiis quam suis
    bonis fretus,’ as suggested by the Benedictine Editors.
    It occurs just below in the corresponding sentence, ‘suis
    potius bonis quam alieno vitio defendi.’
