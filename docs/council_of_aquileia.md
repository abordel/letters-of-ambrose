# Council of Aquileia
**A.D. 381**

```{centered} THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF AQUILEIA AGAINST THE HERETICS PALLADIUS AND SECUNDIANUS
```

> THE official Record of the Proceedings of this Council seems
> to be inserted among S. Ambrose’s Letters, partly because
> S. Ambrose took the leading part in them, and partly because
> they form the subject of the next series of letters, directly
> of the four first, and more indirectly of the two next, all of
> which, though written in the name of the Bishops of Italy, we
> may presume to have been S. Ambrose’s composition. The Council
> was held in the year 381 A.D., the same year in which the
> Second General Council was held at Constantinople. It will be
> remembered that that Council, being summoned by Theodosius, then
> Emperor of the East, consisted of Eastern Bishops only. At this
> time Arianism, though rife in the East, seems not to have been
> prevalent in the West. S. Ambrose says, (Letter xi. 1.) ‘as
> regards the West, two individuals only have been found to dare
> to oppose the Council with profane and impious words, men who
> had previously disturbed a mere corner of Dacia Ripensis.’ These
> two men were Palladius and Secundianus. Palladius appears to
> have applied to Gratian to call a General Council, on the plea
> that he was falsely accused of Arianism, in 379 A.D. Gratian
> granted his request, but afterwards, as we learn from his letter
> read at the Council, on the representation of S. Ambrose that
> such a question as the soundness or heresy of two Bishops might
> be settled by a Council of the Bishops of the Diocese of Italy,
> he so far altered his original order as to summon only these,
> giving permission for others to attend if they pleased. This
> reconsideration, and perhaps also the troubles that prevailed in
> the Empire at the time, (Tillemont Vie de S. Ambr. ch. xxiii.)
> caused such delay that it was not till towards the end of
> 381 A.D. that the Council assembled under the presidency of S.
> Valerian Bishop of Aquileia. The Bishops of Italy, with deputies
> from Gaul, Africa, and Illyria, to the number of thirty two or
> thirty three (see note[^37]) met at Aquileia at the beginning
> of September. The discussion recorded in the ‘Gesta’ took place
> probably on Septr. 3rd (see note[^18]) but S. Ambrose’s words in
> § 2 imply that previous discussions had been held of which no
> Record had been taken, (diu citra acta tractavimus.)
> 
> The proceedings commence by the reading of the Emperor’s Mandate.
> Palladius then raises objections on the ground of the absence
> of the Bishops from the East, and charges S. Ambrose with having
> tricked the Emperor into summoning only a small Council, and
> declines to take part in a Council which is not General. After
> some discussion on this point S. Ambrose proposes that Arius’
> letter from Nicomedia to S. Alexander should be read in detail,
> and Palladius called upon to condemn each heretical proposition.
> Palladius argues upon each, but eventually returns to his
> refusal to answer except in a General Council. In the end all
> the Bishops pronounce their decisions one by one, all agreeing
> that Palladius’ doctrine was heretical and that he should be
> deposed. Secundianus is then more briefly dealt with in the same
> way. It would seem that the Record is incomplete, as the number
> of Bishops who give their decision is only 25, and the account
> of Secundianus’ case ends abruptly without recording any
> decision. It may be from the same cause that the Record itself
> is in one or two places seemingly defective, and the sense
> confused.
> 
> Secundianus is not mentioned again in History. Of Palladius
> it is said by Vigilius, Bishop of Thapsus in Africa, who lived
> in the latter part of the 5th Century, that after S. Ambrose’s
> death he wrote a reply to his writings against Arianism, which
> Vigilius himself answered (Tillemont Vie de S. Ambr. xxvi.).
> 
> The genuineness of the Gesta has been disputed by Père Chifflet,
> who maintained that they were a forgery of the Vigilius
> mentioned above: his arguments however are satisfactorily
> refuted by Tillemont in an elaborate note. (Vol. x. p. 738.

1\. IN the consulship of the illustrious SYAGRIUS and EUCHERIUS, on the
3rd day of September[^18], the under-mentioned Bishops[^19], sitting in
council in the church at Aquileia, namely, VALERIAN, Bishop of Aquileia,
AMBROSE, EUSEBIUS, LIMENIUS, ANEMIUS, SABINUS, ABUNDANTIUS, ARTEMIUS,
CONSTANTIUS, JUSTUS, PHILASTER, CONSTANTIUS, THEODORUS, ALMACHIUS,
DOMNINUS, AMANTIUS, MAXIMUS, FELIX, BASSIANUS, NUMIDIUS, JANUARIUS,
PROCULUS, HELIODORUS, JOVINUS, FELIX, EXUPERANTIUS, DIOGENES, MAXIMUS,
MACEDONIUS, CASSIANUS, MARCELLUS, and EUSTATHIUS, Bishops:

Ambrose, Bishop, said;

2\. ‘We have long been dealing with the matter without any Records[^20],
and now, since our ears are assailed with such sacrilegious words on
the part of Palladius and Secundianus, that one can scarce believe that
they could have so openly blasphemed, and that they may not attempt
hereafter by any subtlety to deny their own words, though the testimony
of such eminent Bishops does not admit of doubt, still as it is the
pleasure of all the Bishops, let Records be made, that no one may be
able to deny his own profession. Do you therefore, holy men, declare
what is your pleasure.’

All the Bishops said, ‘It is our pleasure.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said, ‘Our discussions must be confirmed by the
Emperor’s Letter, as the subject requires, so that they may be quoted.’

3\. The Letter is read by Sabinianus a Deacon;

“Desirous to make our earliest efforts to prevent dissension among
Bishops from uncertainty what doctrines they should reverence, we
had ordered the Bishops to come together into the city of Aquileia,
out of the diocese[^21] which has been confided to the merits of your
Excellency. For controversies of dubious import could not be better
disentangled than by our constituting the Bishops themselves expounders
of the dispute that has arisen, so that the same persons from whom
come forth the instructions of doctrine may solve the contradictions
of discordant teaching.

4\. “Nor is our present order different from our last: we do not alter
the tenour of our command, but we correct the superfluous numbers that
would have assembled. For as Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, eminent both for
the merits of his life and the favour of God, suggests that there is no
occasion for numbers in a case in which the truth, though in the hands
of a few supporters, would not suffer from many antagonists, and that
he and the Bishops of the adjoining cities of Italy would be more than
sufficient to meet the assertions of the opposite party, we have judged
it right to refrain from troubling venerable men by bringing into
strange lands any one who was either loaded with years, or disabled
with bodily weakness, or in the slender circumstances of honourable
poverty;[^22] etc.”

5\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘This is what a Christian Emperor has
ordained. He has not thought fit to do an injury to the Bishops: he
has constituted the Bishops themselves Judges. And therefore since we
sit together in a Council of Bishops, answer to what is proposed to
you. Arius’s letter has been read: it shall be recited now again, if
you think proper. It contains blasphemies from the beginning; it says
that the Father alone is eternal. If you think that the Son of God is
not everlasting, support this doctrine in what manner you please: if
you think it is a doctrine to be condemned, condemn it. Here is the
Gospel, and the Apostle[^23]: all the Scriptures are at hand. Support it
from what quarter you please, if you think that the Son of God is not
everlasting.’

6\. PALLADIUS said; ‘You have contrived, as appears by the sacred
document[^24] which you have brought forward, that this should not be
a full and General Council: in the absence of our Colleagues we cannot
answer.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said: ‘Who are your colleagues?’

Palladius said: ‘The Eastern Bishops.’

7\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said: ‘Inasmuch as in former times the usage of
Councils has been that the Eastern Bishops should be appointed to hold
them in the East, and the Western Bishops in the West, we, having our
place in the West, are come together to the city of Aquileia according
to the Emperor’s command. Moreover, the Prefect of Italy has issued
letters, that if the Eastern Bishops chose to meet, they should be
allowed to do so; but inasmuch as they know that the custom is that the
Council of the Eastern Bishops should be in the East and of the Western
in the West, they have therefore thought fit not to come.’

8\. PALLADIUS said: ‘Our Emperor Gratian commanded the Eastern Bishops
to come: do you deny that he did so? the Emperor himself told us that
he had commanded the Eastern Bishops to come.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said: ‘He certainly commanded them, in that he did not
forbid them to come hither.’

Palladius said: ‘But your prayer has prevented their coming: under a
pretence of benevolence you have obtained this, and so put the Council
off.’

9\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said: ‘There is no occasion to wander any longer
from the subject: answer now. Did Arius say rightly that the Father
alone is eternal? and did he say this in agreement with the Scriptures
or not?’

Palladius said: ‘I do not answer you.’

Constantius, Bishop, said: ‘Do not you answer when you have so long
blasphemed?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said: ‘But you are under an obligation to express
frankly the faith you claim the right to hold. If a heathen were to ask
of you in what way you believe in Christ, you would be bound not to be
ashamed to confess.’

10\. SABINUS, Bishop, said: ‘It was your own request that we would
answer: we come together this day according to your wish, and upon your
own solicitation, and we have not waited for our other brethren, who
might have come. It is therefore not open to you to wander from the
subject. Do you say that Christ was created? or do you say that the
Son of God is everlasting?’

Palladius said: ‘I have told you already: we said we would come and
prove that you have not done well to take advantage of the Emperor.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said: ‘Let Palladius’s letter be read to shew whether
he sent us this message, and it will appear that even now he is
deceiving.’

Palladius said: ‘Let it be read by all means.’

The Bishops said: ‘When you saw the Emperor at Sirmium, did you address
him, or was it he that pressed you?’ And they added: ‘What do you
answer to this?’

Palladius answered: ‘He said to me, “Go.” We said: “Are the Eastern
Bishops summoned to attend?” He said, “They are.” Should we have come
if the Eastern Bishops had not been summoned?’

11\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said: ‘Let the matter of the Eastern Bishops
stand over. I enquire at present into your sentiments. Arius’s letter
has been read to you: you are in the habit of denying that you are an
Arian. Either condemn Arius now, or defend him.’

Palladius said: ‘It is not within the compass of your authority to ask
this of me.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said: ‘We do not believe that the religious Emperor
said other than he wrote. He has ordered the Bishops to meet: it is
impossible that he said to you and no one else contrary to his own
letter, that the case was not to be discussed without the presence of
the Eastern Bishops.’

Palladius said: ‘He did, if the Italian Bishops alone were ordered to
assemble.’

Evagrius, Presbyter and deputy, said:[^25] [It is plain] ‘that he
promised to appear within four and even within two days. What then were
you waiting for? was it, as you say, that you considered the opinion
of your colleagues, the Eastern Bishops was to be waited for? Then you
ought to have said so in your message, and not to have pledged yourself
to discussion.’

Palladius said: ‘I had come, believing it to be a General Council, but
I saw that my colleagues had not assembled. I decided however[^26] to
come, in accordance with the summons, to bid you to do nothing to the
prejudice of a future Council.’

12\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said: ‘You yourself required that we should sit
to-day, moreover, even this very day you have said yourself “we come
as Christians to Christians.” You have therefore acknowledged us for
Christians. You promised that you would engage in discussion: you
promised that you would either assign your own reasons or accept ours.
We therefore willingly accepted your opening, we wished that you should
come as a Christian. I offered you the letter of Arius, which that
Arius wrote, from whose name you say that you often suffer wrong. You
say that you do not follow Arius. To-day your sentiments must be made
clear; either condemn him, or support him by whatever passage you will.’

He went on; ‘Then according to Arius’s letter Christ the Son of God is
not everlasting?’

Palladius said; ‘We said that we would prove ourselves Christians, but
in a full Council. We do not answer you at all to the prejudice of a
future Council.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘You ought to state your profession of faith
straightforwardly.’

Palladius said; ‘And what do we reserve for the Council?’

13\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘He has been unanimously condemned who
denies the Eternity of the Son of God. Arius denied it, Palladius, who
will not condemn Arius, follows him. Consider then, whether his opinion
is approved of; it is easy to perceive whether he speaks according to
the Scriptures, or against the Scriptures. For we read: _God’s eternal
Power and Godhead_. Christ is the Power of God. If then the Power of
God is everlasting, Christ surely is everlasting; for _Christ is the
Power of God_.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘This is our faith: this is the Catholic
doctrine; who says not this, let him be anathema.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

14\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘He says specifically that the Father alone
is everlasting, and that the Son at some time began to be.’

Palladius said; ‘I have neither seen Arius, nor do I know who he is.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘The blasphemy of Arius has been produced, in
which he denies that the Son of God is everlasting. Do you condemn this
wickedness and its author, or do you support it?’

Palladius said; ‘When there is not the authority of a full Council, I
do not speak.’

```{margin}
**Acts i. 18.**
```

15\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Do you hesitate after the divine judgements
to condemn Arius, when he has _burst asunder in the midst_?’ and he
added; ‘Let the holy men too, the deputies of the Gauls, speak.’

Constantius, Bishop and deputy of the Gauls, said; ‘This impiety of
that man we always have condemned, and we now condemn not only Arius,
but also whoever does not say that the Son of God is everlasting.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘What says also my Lord Justus?’

Justus, Bishop and deputy of the Gauls, said; ‘He who does not confess
that the Son of God is co-eternal with the Father, let him be accounted
Anathema.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

16\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Let the deputies of the Africans speak too,
who have brought hither the sentiments of all their countrymen.’

Felix, Bishop and deputy, said; ‘If any man denies that the Son of God
is everlasting, and that He is co-eternal with the Father, not only do
I the deputy of the whole province of Africa condemn him, but also the
whole priestly company, which sent me to this most holy assembly, has
itself also already condemned him.’

Anemius, Bishop, said; ‘There is no capital of Illyricum[^27] but
Sirmium: I am its Bishop. The person who does not confess the Son of
God to be eternal and co-eternal with the Father, that is, everlasting,
I call anathema; and I also say anathema to those who do not make the
same confession.’

17\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Hear what follows.’ Then it was read;
“Alone eternal, alone without beginning, alone true, Who alone has
immortality.”

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In this also condemn him who denies that the
Son is very God. For since He Himself is the Truth, how is He not very
God?’ And he added; ‘What say you to this?’

Palladius said; ‘Who denies that He is very Son?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Arius denied it.’

Palladius said; ‘When the Apostle says that Christ is God over all, can
any one deny that He is the very Son of God?’

18\. Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘That you may see with how much simplicity
we seek the truth, lo, I say as you say: but I have then only half the
truth. For by speaking thus, you appear to deny that He is very God; if
however you confess simply that the Son of God is very God, state it in
the order in which I propose it to you.’

Palladius said; ‘I speak to you according to the Scriptures: I call the
Lord the very Son of God.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Do you call the Son of God very Lord?’

Palladius said; ‘When I call Him very Son, what more is wanted?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘I do not ask only that you should call Him very
Son, but that you should call the Son of God very Lord.’

19\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘Is Christ very God, according to the faith
of all and to the Catholic profession?’

Palladius said; ‘He is the very Son of God.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘We also are by adoption sons; He is Son
according to the property of His Divine Generation.’ And he added;
‘Do you confess that the very Son of God is very Lord by His Birth
and essentially?’

Palladius said; ‘I call Him the very Son of God, only-begotten.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Do you then think it is against the Scriptures,
for Christ to be called very God?’

20\. PALLADIUS being silent, Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘He who says only
that He is the very Son of God, and will not say that He is very Lord,
appears to deny it. Let Palladius then, if he does confess it, confess
it in this order, and let him say whether he calls the Son of God very
Lord.’

```{margin}
**S. John xvii. 3.**
```

Palladius said; ‘When the Son says, _That they might know Thee the only
true God and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent_, is it by way of feeling
only, or in truth?’

```{margin}
**1 S. John v. 20.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘John said in his epistle; _This is the true
God_. Deny this.’

Palladius said; ‘When I tell you that He is true Son, I acknowledge
also a true Godhead.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In this also there is evasion; for you art wont
to speak of one only and true Godhead in such manner as to say that it
is the divinity of the Father only, and not that of the Son also, which
is one only and true. If then you wish to speak plainly, as you refer
me to the Scriptures, say what the Evangelist John said; _This is the
true God_, or deny that he hath said it.’

Palladius said; ‘Besides the Son there is none other that is begotten.’

21\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘Is Christ very God, according to the faith
of all and to the Catholic profession, or in your opinion is He not
very God?’

Palladius said; ‘He is the Power of our God.’

Ambrose, Bishop said; ‘You do not speak frankly; and so anathema to him
who does not confess that the Son of God is very Lord.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Let him be accounted anathema, who will not call
Christ, the Son of God, very Lord.’

22\. The reader continued; “Alone true, Who alone hath immortality.”

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Has the Son of God immortality, or has He it
not, in respect of His Godhead?’

```{margin}
**1 Tim. vi. 16.**
```

Palladius said; ‘Do you accept or no the words of the Apostle, _The
King of kings Who alone hath immortality_?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘What say you of Christ the Son of God?’

Palladius said; ‘Is Christ a divine Name or a human?’

23\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘He is called Christ indeed according to
the mystery of His Incarnation, but He is both God and Man.’

Palladius said; ‘Christ is a name of the flesh: Christ is a man’s name:
do you answer me.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Why do you dwell upon useless topics? When
Arius’ impious words were read, who says of the Father that He alone
hath immortality, you cited a testimony in confirmation of Arius’
impiety, quoting from the Apostle, _Who only hath immortality, dwelling
in the light which no man can approach unto_. But if you understand it,
he has expressed by the Name of God the dignity of the whole Nature,
inasmuch as in the Name of God, both Father and Son are signified.’

Palladius said; ‘You also have not chosen to answer what I have asked.’

24\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘I ask you to give your opinion plainly, has
the Son of God immortality according to His divine generation, or has
He not?’

Palladius said; ‘In respect of His divine generation He is
incorruptible; and by means of His Incarnation He died.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘His divinity died not, but His flesh died.’

Palladius said; ‘Do you answer me first.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Has the Son of God immortality in respect of
His Godhead or has He it not? But have you not even now betrayed your
fraudulent and insidious meaning according to Arius’ profession?’
and he added; ‘He who denies that the Son of God has immortality,
what think you of him?’ All the Bishops said; ‘Let him be accounted
anathema.’

25\. PALLADIUS said; ‘A divine offspring is immortal.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘This also have you said evasively, to avoid
expressing anything clearly about the Son of God. I say to you, the Son
hath immortality in respect of His Godhead, or do you deny it and say
that He has not.’

Palladius said; ‘Did Christ die or not?’

```{margin}
**S. Matt. x. 28.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In respect of the flesh He did: our soul does
not die: for it is written, _Fear not them who kill the body, but are
not able to kill the soul_; seeing then that our soul cannot die, do
you think Christ died in respect of His Godhead?’

Palladius said; ‘Why do you shrink from the name of death?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Nay, I do not shrink from it, but I confess it
in respect of my flesh: for there is One by Whom I am released from the
chains of death.’

Palladius said; ‘Death is caused by separation of the spirit (from the
flesh), for Christ the Son of God took upon Him flesh, and by means of
flesh he died.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘It is written that Christ suffered: He
suffered then in respect of His flesh: in respect of His Godhead He
has immortality. He who denies this, is a devil.’

Palladius said; ‘I know not Arius.’

26\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Then Arius said ill, since the Son of God
also has immortality in respect of his Godhead.’ And he added, ‘Did he
then say well or ill?’

Palladius said; ‘I do not agree.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘With whom do not you agree? Anathema to him,
who does not frankly unfold his faith.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

Palladius said; ‘Say what you please; His Godhead is immortal.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Whose? the Father’s or the Son’s?’ And he added:
‘Arius heaped together many impieties. But let us pass to other points.’

27\. Then was recited; “Alone wise.”

Palladius said; ‘The Father is wise of himself, but the Son is not
wise.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is then the Son not wise, when He Himself is
Wisdom? For we also say that the Son is begotten of the Father.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Is there anything as impious and profane as
this which he said, that the Son of God is not wise?’

Palladius said; ‘He is called Wisdom, who can deny that he is Wisdom?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is He wise or not?’

Palladius said; ‘He is Wisdom.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Then He is wise, if He is Wisdom.’

Palladius said; ‘We answer you according to the Scriptures.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Palladius, as far as I can see, has attempted
to deny also that the Son of God is wise.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘He who denies that the Son of God is wise, let
him be anathema.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

28\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘Let Secundianus also answer to this.’

Secundianus being silent,

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘He who is silent wishes to reserve his
judgement.’ And he added, ‘When he says that the Father alone is good,
did he confess the Son or deny Him?’

```{margin}
**S. John x. 11.**
```

Palladius said; ‘We read, _I am the good Shepherd_, and do we deny it?
Who would not say that the Son of God is good?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Then is Christ good?’

Palladius said; ‘He is good.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Arius then was wrong in asserting it of the
Father alone, since the Son of God also is a good[^28] God.’

Palladius said; ‘He who says that Christ is not good, says ill.’

**S. Luke xix. 17.**

**Ib. vi. 45.**

29\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘Do you confess that Christ is a good God?
For I also am good. He has said to me; _Well done, thou good servant_;
and, _A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good_.’

Palladius said; ‘I have already said, I do not answer you until there
is a full Council.’

```{margin}
**S. John vii. 12.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘The Jews said _He is a good man_; and Arius
denies that the Son of God is good.’

Palladius said; ‘Who can deny it?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Then the Son of God is a good God.’

Palladius said; ‘The good Father begat a good Son.’

30\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘We also are begotten of Him and are good,
but not in respect of Godhead. Do you call the Son of God a good God?’

Palladius said; ‘The Son of God is good.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You see then that you call him a good Christ, a
good Son, not a good God; which is what is asked of you.’ And he added;
‘He who does not confess that the Son of God is a good God, Anathema to
him.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

31\. The reader likewise continued; “Alone mighty.”

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is the Son of God mighty or not?’

Palladius said; ‘He Who made all things, is He not mighty? He Who made
all things, is He deficient in might?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said: ‘Then Arius said ill.’ And he added; ‘Do you
even in this condemn Arius?’

Palladius said; ‘How do I know who he is? I answer you for myself.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is the Son of God the mighty God?’

Palladius said; ‘He is mighty.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is the Son of God the mighty God?’

Palladius said; ‘I have already said that the only-begotten Son of God
is mighty.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘The mighty Lord.’

Palladius said; ‘The mighty Son of God.’

```{margin}
**Ps. lii. 1.**

**2 Cor. xii. 10.**
```

32\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Men also are mighty; for it is written,
_Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, thou mighty man?_ and in
another place, _When I am weak, then am I strong_. I ask you to confess
that Christ the Son of God is the mighty Lord; or if you deny it,
support your denial. For I speak of one Power of the Father and of the
Son, and I call the Son of God mighty in the same way as the Father. Do
you hesitate then to confess that the Son of God is the mighty Lord?’

Palladius said; ‘I have already said, we answer you in discussion as
we can; for you wish to be sole judges, and at the same time parties to
the case. We do not answer you now, but we will answer you in a General
and full Council.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Anathema to him who denies that Christ is the
mighty Lord.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

33\. It was likewise recited; “Alone mighty, Judge of all.”

Palladius said; ‘The Son of God, the Judge of all. There is Who gives,
there is who receives.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Did He give by grace or nature? Men also have
judgement given them.’

Palladius said; ‘Do you call the Father greater or not?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘I will answer you afterwards.’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you, if you do not answer me.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Unless you condemn in order the impiety of
Arius, we will give you no power of asking questions.’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Is the Son of God, as has been read, Judge or
not?’

Palladius said; ‘If you do not answer me, I do not answer you, as being
an impious person.’

34\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘You have my profession, whereby I will
answer you. In the mean time, let Arius’ letter be read through.’ And
he added: ‘In that letter you will find that sacrilegious argument also
which you are endeavouring at.’

Palladius said; ‘When I ask, do you not answer?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘We call the Son of God equal God.’

Palladius said: ‘You are Judge: your note-takers are here.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Let any of yours write, who please.’

35\. PALLADIUS said; ‘Is the Father greater or not?’

**S. John v. 18.**
```

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘In respect of His Godhead the Son is equal

_because He not only broke the sabbath, but also called God His Father,
making Himself equal with God_; what then impious men confessed while
they persecuted, we who believe cannot deny.’

**Phil. ii. 6–8.**

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘And in another place you have: _Who being
in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but
emptied himself[^29] and took upon him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of men; and became obedient unto death_. You see
that in the form of God He is equal to God. And _he took_, S. Paul says,
_the form of a servant_. In what then is He less? In respect surely of
His form of a servant, not of the form of God?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Just as, being established in the form of a
servant, He was not less than a servant; so being established in the
form of God, He could not be less than God.’

36\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Or say that in respect of Godhead the Son
of God is less.’

Palladius said; ‘The Father is greater.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In respect of the flesh.’

```{margin}
**S. John xiv. 28.**
```

Palladius said; ‘_He who sent me, is greater than I_. Was the flesh
sent by God or was the Son of God sent?’

```{margin}
**Ib. 27, 28.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘We prove this day that the holy Scriptures are
falsely cited by you, for thus it is written: _Peace I leave unto you,
my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid: If ye loved me,
ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father
is greater than I._ He did not say, He Who sent me is greater than I.’

Palladius said; ‘The Father is greater.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Anathema to him, who adds to or takes from the
holy Scriptures.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

37\. PALLADIUS said; ‘The Father is greater than the Son.’

```{margin}
**Heb. ii. 7.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In respect of the flesh the Son is less than
the Father: in respect of Godhead He is equal to the Father: I read
therefore that the Son of God is equal to the Father, as also the
instances that have been adduced testify. But why should you wonder
that He is less in respect of the flesh, when He has called Himself
a servant, a stone, a worm, when He has said that He is less than the
angels, for it is written: _Thou madest him a little lower than the
angels_.’

Palladius said; ‘I see that you make impious assertions. We do not
answer you without arbiters.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘Let no one ask for an opinion from him who has
blasphemed in such countless opinions.’

Palladius said; ‘We do not answer you.’

38\. SABINUS, Bishop, said; ‘Palladius has now been condemned by all.
The blasphemies of Arius are much lighter than those of Palladius.’

```{margin}
**Ib. vi. 13.**

**S. John viii. 56.**
```

And when Palladius rose, as if he wished to go out, he said; ‘Palladius
has risen, because he sees that he is to be convicted by manifest
testimonies of the Scriptures, as indeed he has been already convicted:
for thus it has been read, that in respect of Godhead the Son is equal
to the Father. Let him admit that in respect of His Godhead the Son of
God has no greater: it is written: _When God made promise to Abraham,
because He could swear by no greater, he swear by himself_. You see
therefore the Scripture, that He could swear by no greater. But it is
the Son of Whom this is said, since it was He Who appeared to Abraham,
whence also He says, _He saw my day and was glad_.’

Palladius said; ‘The Father is greater.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘When He spake as God, He had no greater; when
He spake as man, He had one greater.’

39\. PALLADIUS said; ‘The Father begat the Son; the Father sent the Son.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Anathema to him, who denies that in respect of
His Godhead the Son is equal to the Father.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema.’

Palladius said; ‘The Son is subject to the Father; the Son keeps the
commands of the Father.’

```{margin}
**S. John vi. 44.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘He is subject in respect of His Incarnation.
But even you yourself remember that you have read; _No man can come
unto me, except the Father draw him_.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘Let him say whether the Son is subject to the
Father in respect of His Godhead, or in respect of His Incarnation.’

40\. PALLADIUS said; ‘Then the Father is greater.’

```{margin}
**1 Cor. i. 8.**
```

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In another place also it is written; _God
is faithful, by Whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son_.
I say that the Father is greater in respect of the assumption of the
flesh, which the Son of God took upon Him, not in respect of the Son’s
Godhead.’

Palladius said; ‘What then is the comparison of the Son of God? And can
flesh say, God is greater than I? Did the flesh speak or the Godhead
because the flesh was there?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘The flesh does not speak without the soul.’

```{margin}
**S. John viii. 40.**
```

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘God in the flesh spoke according to the flesh,
when He said, _Why do ye persecute[^30] me, a man?_ Who said this?’

Palladius said; ‘The Son of God.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Then the Son of God is God in respect of His
Godhead and is man in respect of His flesh.’

Palladius said; ‘He took flesh upon Him.’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Accordingly He made use of human words.’

Palladius said; ‘He took man’s flesh upon Him.’

41\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Let him say that the Apostle did not call
Him subject in respect of His Godhead, but in respect of His flesh; for
it is written, _He humbled himself and became obedient unto death_. In
what then did He taste death?’

Palladius said; ‘In that He humbled Himself.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Not His Godhead but His flesh was humbled and
subject.’ And he added; ‘Did Arius well or ill in calling him a perfect
creature?’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you, for you have no authority.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Profess what you please.’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you.’

42\. SABINUS, Bishop, said; ‘Do you not answer on behalf of Arius? do
you not answer to what has been asked?’

Palladius said; ‘I have not answered on behalf of Arius.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘You have answered so far as to deny that the
Son of God is mighty, to deny that He is true God.’

Palladius said; ‘I do not allow you to be my judge, whom I convict of
impiety.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘You yourself forced us to sit.’

Palladius said; ‘I gave in a request that you might sit, in order that
I might convict you. Why have you practised upon the Emperor? You have
gained by intrigue that the Council should not be a plenary one.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘When Arius’ impieties were read, your impiety
also, which harmonized with his, was condemned equally. You have
thought fit while the letter was in the midst of being read, to bring
forward whatever passages you would: you were told in answer in what
way the Son has said that the Father is greater, because in respect
of His taking flesh upon Him, the Father is greater than He. You have
urged also that the Son of God is subject; and on this head you were
answered that the Son of God is subject in respect of His flesh, not
in respect of His divinity. You have our profession. Now hear the rest.
Since you have been answered, do you answer to what is read.’

43\. PALLADIUS said; ‘I do not answer you, because what I have said has
not been recorded; only your words are recorded. I do not answer you.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You see that every thing is recorded. Moreover,
what has been written is abundant for the proof of your impiety.’ And
he added; ‘Do you say that Christ is a creature or do you deny it?’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘An hour ago, when it was read that Arius called
Christ a creature, you denied it: you had an opportunity offered you of
condemning his perfidy; you would not. Say now at last whether Christ
was begotten of the Father or created.’

Palladius said; ‘If you please, let my reporters come and so let the
whole be taken down.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘Let him send for his reporters.’

Palladius said; ‘We will answer you in a full Council.’

44\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Attalus subscribed the formula[^31] of the
Council of Nicæa. Let him deny it, as he has come to our Council. Let
him say to-day, whether he subscribed the formula of the Council of
Nicæa or no?’

Attalus remaining silent,

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Though the presbyter Attalus is an Arian,
yet we give him permission to speak: let him frankly state whether
he subscribed the formula of the Council of Nicæa under his Bishop
Agrippinus, or no.’

Attalus said; ‘You have already said that I have been several times
condemned. I do not answer you.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Did you subscribe the formula of the Council of
Nicæa or no?’

Attalus said; ‘I do not answer you.’

45\. PALLADIUS said; ‘Do you now wish the formula to be regarded as
general or no?’

Chromatius, presbyter, said; ‘You have not denied that He is a creature,
you have denied that He is mighty. You have denied every thing which
the Catholic Faith professes.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘We are witnesses that Attalus subscribed
the Council of Nicæa, and that he now refuses to answer. What is the
opinion of all?’

As Attalus did not speak,

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Let him say whether he subscribed the formula
of the Council of Nicæa or no.’

46\. PALLADIUS said; ‘Let your reporter and ours stand forward and write
down every thing.’

Valerian, Bishop, said; ‘What you have said and what you have denied is
already all written.’

Palladius said; ‘Say what you please.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Since Palladius who has been already many
times condemned, wishes to be condemned still oftener, I am reading
the letter of Arius which he has not chosen to condemn: do you state
whether you approve of my doing so.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Let it be read.’

Then the words were read. “But begotten not putatively,” &c.

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘I have answered you on the Father’s being
greater: I have answered you also on the Son’s being subject: do you
yourself answer now.’

47\. PALLADIUS said; ‘I will not answer unless arbiters come after the
Lord’s day.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You were come with a view to discussion, but
since I have charged you with its doctrines, you have seen the letter
of Arius which you have not chosen to condemn and which you cannot
support: you now therefore shrink back and cavil. I read it to you
fully point by point. Tell me whether you believe Christ to have been
created; whether there was a time when he was not; or whether the only
begotten Son of God has always existed. When you have heard Arius’
letter, either condemn it or approve of it.’

48\. PALLADIUS said; ‘Since I convict you of impiety, I will not have
you for judge. You are a transgressor.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘Say, what impieties you object to our brother
and fellow-bishop Ambrose.’

Palladius said; ‘I have already told you, I will answer in a full
Council, and with arbiters present.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘I desire to be confuted and convicted in the
assembly of my brethren. Say then what I have said impiously; but I
appear impious to you because I support piety.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘Does then he seem impious to you, who censures
the blasphemies of Arius?’

49\. PALLADIUS said; ‘I have not denied that the Son of God is good.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Do you say that Christ is a good God?’

Palladius said; ‘I do not answer you.’

Valerian, Bishop, said; ‘Do not press Palladius so much: he cannot
confess our truths with simplicity. For his conscience is confused
with a twofold blasphemy: he was ordained by the Photinians and was
condemned with them, and now he shall be condemned more fully.’

Palladius said; ‘Prove it.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘He would not have denied that Christ is true if
he were not following his own teachers.’

50\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘You have objected to me that I am impious:
prove it.’

Palladius said; ‘We will bring forward our statement, and when we have
brought it, then the discussion shall be held.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Condemn the impiety of Arius.’

Palladius being silent,

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘He dwells upon useless subjects. There are so
many impieties of Arius, which Palladius has not chosen to condemn, nay
rather has confessed by supporting. He who does not condemn Arius is
like him, and is rightly to be called a heretic.’

All the Bishops said; ‘On the part of us all let Palladius be anathema.’

51\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Do you consent, Palladius, that the other
statements of Arius be read?’

Palladius said; ‘Give us arbiters: let reporters come on both sides.
You cannot be judges unless we have arbitrators and unless persons come
on both sides to arbitrate, we do not answer you.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘What arbitrators do you wish for?’

Palladius said; ‘There are here many men of high rank.’

Sabinus, Bishop, said; ‘After such a number of blasphemies do you wish
for arbitrators?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Bishops ought to judge of laymen: not laymen of
Bishops. But tell me what judges you wish for.’

Palladius said; ‘Let arbitrators attend.’

Chromatius, the Presbyter, said; ‘Without prejudice to condemnation
by the Bishops, let those also who are of Palladius’ party be heard at
full length.’

52\. PALLADIUS said; ‘They are not allowed to speak. Let arbitrators
attend and reporters on both sides, and then they will answer you in
a General Council.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Though he has been convicted of many impieties,
yet we should blush that a person who claims the priesthood for himself
should seem to have been condemned by laymen, and on this very ground
and in this very point he deserves condemnation because he looks to
the sentence of laymen, when priests ought rather to be the judges of
laymen. Looking to what we have this day heard Palladius professing
and to what he has refused to condemn, I pronounce him unworthy of the
priesthood, and I judge that he should be deprived[^32] thereof in order
that a Catholic may be ordained in his place.’

All the Bishops said; ‘Anathema to Palladius.’

53\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘The most gracious and Christian Emperor has
committed the cause to the judgement of the Bishops and has constituted
them arbitrators of the dispute[^33]. Since therefore the decision
appears to have been made over to us, so that we are the interpreters
of the Scriptures, let us condemn Palladius, who has not chosen to
condemn the sentiments of the impious Arius, and because he has himself
denied the Son of God to be everlasting, and made the other statements
which appear in our proceedings. Let him therefore be accounted
Anathema.’

All the Bishops said; ‘We all condemn him; let him be accounted
anathema.’

54\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Since all who are met here are Christian
men, brethren approved of God, and our fellow-bishops, let each
individual say, what he thinks.’

Valerian, Bishop, said; ‘My sentence is that he who defends Arius is
an Arian; that he who does not condemn his blasphemies is himself a
blasphemer; and therefore I judge that such a man is alien from the
fellowship of Bishops.’

Palladius said; ‘You have begun to play; play on. Without an Eastern
Council we answer you not.’

55\. ANEMIUS, Bishop of Sirmium, said; ‘Whoever does not condemn the
heresies of Arius must of necessity be an Arian. Him therefore I judge
to be alien from our communion, and to be without place in the assembly
of Bishops.’

Constantius, Bishop of Orange, said; ‘As Palladius is a disciple of
Arius, whose impieties have been long since condemned by our Fathers
in the Council of Nice, but have this day severally, when recited,
been approved of by Palladius, inasmuch as he was not disturbed at his
acknowledging that the Son of God was not of the same Nature with God
the Father, and at his calling Him a creature, and saying that He began
to be in time, and denying Him to be true Lord, on these grounds, I
judge that he should be condemned for ever.’

56\. JUSTUS, Bishop, said; ‘Palladius who has refused to condemn the
blasphemies of Arius, and who seems rather to acknowledge them, can in
my judgement no longer be called a Priest or be reckoned among Bishops.’

Eventius, Bishop of Ticinum, said; ‘I think that Palladius who has
refused to condemn the impieties of Arius, is removed for ever from the
fellowship of Bishops.’

57\. ABUNDANTIUS, Bishop of Trent, said; ‘Since Palladius maintains
evident blasphemies, let him know that he is condemned by the Council
of Aquileia.’

Eusebius, Bishop of Bologna, said; ‘Inasmuch as Palladius has not only
refused to condemn the impieties of Arius, impieties written with the
pen of the devil, and which it is not lawful so much as to listen to,
but has also appeared as the maintainer of them by denying that the Son
of God is true Lord, is good Lord, is wise Lord, is everlasting Lord;
both by my sentence, and by the judgement of all Catholics I think that
he is rightly condemned and excluded from the assembly of Bishops.’

58\. SABINUS, Bishop of Placentia, said; ‘Since it has been proved to
all that Palladius supports the Arian perfidy and maintains its impiety
that was counter to the Evangelical and apostolical institutions, a
just sentence of the whole Council has been passed upon him, and humble
individual as I am, let him by my judgement be deprived once more of
the priesthood and banished justly from this most holy assembly.’

Felix and Numidius, deputies of Africa said; ‘Anathema to the Sect
of the Arian heresy to which by the Synod of Aquileia Palladius is
pronounced to belong. But we condemn also those, who contradict the
truth of the Nicene Synod.’

59\. LIMENIUS, Bishop of Vercellæ, said; ‘It is manifest that the Arian
doctrine has been often condemned: and therefore, inasmuch as Palladius
having been appealed to in this holy Synod of Aquileia has refused
to correct and amend himself, and has rather proved himself worthy
of blame and defiled himself with the perfidy which he has publicly
professed himself to hold, I too by my judgement declare that he is
to be deprived of the fellowship of the Bishops.’

Maximus, Bishop of Emona, said; ‘That Palladius, who would not condemn,
but has rather himself acknowledged, the blasphemies of Arius, is
justly and deservedly condemned God knows, and the conscience of the
faithful has condemned him.’

60\. EXUPERANTIUS, Bishop of Dertona, said; ‘As the rest of my
Colleagues have condemned Palladius who has refused to condemn the sect
and doctrine of Arius, and on the contrary has defended them, I also
likewise condemn him.’

Bassianus, Bishop of Lodi, said; ‘I have heard along with the rest of
my Colleagues the impieties of Arius, which Palladius not only has not
condemned but has confirmed. Let him be anathema and be deprived of the
priesthood.’

61\. PHILASTER, Bishop of Brescia, said; ‘The blasphemies and iniquity
of Palladius, who follows and defends the Arian doctrine I in company
with all have condemned.’

Constantius, Bishop of Sciscia, said; ‘As the rest of my brother
Bishops, I also think that Palladius is to be condemned, who has
refused to condemn the blasphemies and impieties of Arius.’

Heliodorus, Bishop of Altinum, said; ‘The man who maintains the perfidy
of Arius, and of all the heretics with whom Palladius is partner, whose
heart is foolish, and who has not confessed the truth, together with
the rest of my brother Bishops I condemn.’

62\. FELIX, Bishop of Jadera, said; ‘I also in like manner unite with
all in condemning Palladius, who speaks blasphemies against the Son of
God as Arius did.’

Theodorus, Bishop of Octodorum, said; ‘We judge Palladius, who has
denied Christ to be true God, co-eternal with the Father, to be in no
wise either a Christian or a priest.’

Domninus, Bishop of Grenoble, said; ‘As Palladius adheres to the
perfidy of Arius, I also judge that he is to be condemned for ever,
as my brethren also have condemned him.’

63\. PROCULUS, Bishop of Marseilles, said; ‘Palladius, who by a kind
of impious succession to the blasphemies of Arius has defended them
in that he does not condemn them, as he has been already designated a
blasphemer by the sentence of many venerable Bishops, and pronounced
alien from the priesthood, so by my sentence also is marked out in the
same manner as condemned for ever.’

Diogenes, Bishop of Genoa, said; ‘Palladius who while he does not
confess has even denied Christ to be true Lord and God, like and equal
to the Father, I together with the rest of my brethren and fellow
Bishops adjudge to have the lot of condemnation.’

64\. AMANTIUS, Bishop of Nice, said; ‘Palladius, who has refused to
pull down the sect of Arius, according to the judgement of my brother
Bishops, I also condemn.’

Januarius, Bishop, said; ‘As all my brother Bishops have condemned
Palladius so also do I think that he ought to be condemned by a similar
judgement[^34].’

65\. SECUNDIANUS having withdrawn for a while, and then returned to the
Council[^35],

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You have heard, Secundianus, what sort of
sentence the impious Palladius has received, having been condemned by
the Council of Bishops: and though we have been displeased that you
have not shrunk from his madness, I nevertheless make some special
enquiries of you. Do you say that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
is or is not very God?’

Secundianus said; ‘He who denies the Father of our Lord and God Jesus
Christ to be true God is not a Christian, nor is he who denies that the
Lord is the very Son of God.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘Do you confess that the Son of God is very God?’

Secundianus said; ‘I say that He is the very Son of God, the very only
begotten Son of God.’

66\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Do you call Him very Lord?’

Secundianus said; ‘I call Him the very only-begotten Son of God. Who
denies that He is the very Son of God?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘It is not enough that you confess Him to be
the only-begotten Son of God, for all confess this. But what influences
us is that Arius said that the Father alone is Lord, alone is true, and
denied that the Son of God is very Lord. Do you confess simply that the
Son of God is very God?’

```{margin}
**S. John i. 18.**
```

Secundianus said; ‘Who Arius was, I know not; what he said, I know not.
You speak with me, living man with living man. I say what Christ said:
_The only begotten Son Which is in the bosom of the Father_. Therefore
He asserts Himself to be the only-begotten Son of the Father: the
only-begotten Son is then the very Son of God.’

```{margin}
**Isa. lxv. 16.**
```

67\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; “Is the very Son of God also very God? It
is written in the divine books: _he that sweareth on the earth, shall
swear by the true God_, and that this applies to Christ there is no
doubt. We therefore profess the true God, and this is our faith and
profession, that the only-begotten Son of the Father is very God. Do
you then say ‘of very God,’ and then that the Son is very God.”

Secundianus said; ‘Of very God.’

68\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Is the Son of God very God?’

Secundianus said; ‘Then would he be a liar.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘In this you practise an evasion to avoid saying
very God, but instead thereof, God, very only-begotten, and therefore
say simply, The only-begotten Son of God is very God.’

Secundianus said; ‘I called Him the only-begotten Son of God.’

69\. EUSEBIUS, Bishop, said; ‘This Photinus does not deny, this Sabellus
confesses.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘And he who does not confess this is justly
condemned, and on this point I appeal to you many times though by
cavilling you have denied the truth. I do not ask you to call Him
merely the very only-begotten Son of God, but to call Him also very
God.’

Secundianus said; ‘I profess myself the servant of truth. What I say is
not taken down and what you say is taken down. I say that Christ is the
true Son of God. Who denies that He is the true Son of God?’

70\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘He who denies that the only-begotten Son of
God is very God, let him be anathema.’

Secundianus said; ‘The only-begotten Son of God, very God! why do you
state to me what is not written?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said: ‘It is plain sacrilege, that Arius denied Christ
the Son of God to be very God.’

Secundianus said; ‘Forasmuch as Christ is called the Son of God, I call
the Son of God very Son[^36]; but that He is very God is not written.’

71\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Have you not yet recovered your senses?’
And he added; ‘Lest it should appear that he has been unfairly
treated, let him state his opinion. Let him then say that Christ the
only-begotten Son of God is very God.’

Secundianus said; ‘I have already said. What more would you wring from
me?’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘What have you said? certainly if you had said
so great truths, what is said gloriously, may well be often repeated.’

```{margin}
**S. Matt. v. 37.**
```

Secundianus said; ‘It is written, _Let your conversation be yea, yea,
nay, nay_.’

72\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘He who says that the Father Himself is the
Son, is sacrilegious. This I ask of you that you would say that the Son
of God is begotten very God of very God.’

```{margin}
**Heb. i. 5.**
```

Secundianus said; ‘I say that the Son is begotten of God, as He says
Himself _I have begotten Thee_, and that He confesses Himself to be
begotten.’

73\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘Is He very God of very God?’

Secundianus said; ‘When you add to the Name and call Him very [God], do
you understand what the character of your own faith is, and are you a
Christian?’

Eusebius, Bishop, said; ‘Who has denied that He is very God? Arius and
Palladius have denied it. If you believe Him to be very God, you should
simply express it.’

74\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; ‘If you will not say that He is very God
begotten of very God, you have denied Christ.’

Secundianus said; ‘When asked about the Son, I answered you: I have
answered as to the manner in which I ought to make my profession. We
have your statement: we will bring it forward; let it be read.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You should have brought it forward to-day, but
you are attempting a subterfuge. You demand a profession of me and I
demand a profession of you. Is the Son of God very God?’

Secundianus said; ‘The Son of God is God only-begotten. I also ask him:
Is He only-begotten?’

75\. AMBROSE, Bishop, said; “Let reason move us: let us be moved too by
your impiety and folly. When you speak of God very only-begotten, you
do not apply the ‘very’ to ‘God,’ but to ‘only-begotten.’ And therefore
to remove this question answer me this: Is He very God of very God?”

Secundianus said; ‘Did then God not beget God? He Who is very God begat
What He is; He begat one true only-begotten Son.’

Ambrose, Bishop, said; ‘You do not confess Him very God but you would
call Him very only-begotten. I too call Him only-begotten, but also
very God.’

Secundianus said; ‘I say that he was begotten of the Father, I say to
all that he was very begotten[^37].’

[^18]: There can be little doubt that the true date is iii. Non.
    Sept. i. e. the 3rd of Sept., and not Nonis, the 5th. For
    in 381 A.D. the 5th of Sept. was on a Sunday, and it is
    hardly likely that a Council would have sat from daybreak
    till one o’clock (Ep. 10. 5) in the Church on such a day,
    and moreover it would not have been natural for Palladius
    to say, as he does in § 47. Non respondebo nisi auditores
    veniant post Dominicam diem, if he were speaking on a
    Sunday.

[^19]: The reading of Ed. Rom. has been adopted, which omits the
    preposition ‘cum. ’ If this were correct, it would imply
    that the consuls were themselves taking a leading part in
    the Council; whereas it is clear that they are mentioned
    solely as the ordinary way of fixing the year; nor had
    the consuls at this time any other than such ornamental
    functions. See Gibbon’s description, ch. xvii. vol. ii.
    ed. Smith p. 206–208.

[^20]: By ‘acta’ here are meant formal and official records taken
    down and published by authority. Thus Jul. Cæsar ordered
    the ‘Acta’ of the Senate to be regularly published. Suet.
    Cæs. 20.

[^21]: It is to be remembered that ‘diocese’ was then a civil and
    not an Ecclesiastical term. A ‘diœcesis’ was an aggregate
    of provinces, under the charge of a Vicarius, who was
    subordinate to one of the four Præfecti Prætorio, each
    Præfectus having under him a number of dioceses. Thus
    the Vicarius Italiæ, who was subordinate to the Præfectus
    Prætorio Italiæ, had in his diocese fourteen provinces,
    including both Liguria of which Milan was the capital,
    and Venetia in which Aquileia was situated. It is to be
    remembered also that Italia at this time meant only the
    north of Italy, the rest of Italy being now included in
    the Diocese of Rome, and under the Vicarius Urbis Romae.
    See the table given in Smith’s Gibbon, vol. ii. p. 315.
    taken from Marquardt. When the word diocese came into
    Ecclesiastical use, it was applied, first to “an aggregate
    not merely of several districts, governed each by its own
    bishop, but of several provinces (ἐπαρχίαι) each presided
    over by a metropolitan. The diocese itself was under
    an Exarch or Patriarch.” Dict. of Chr. Ant. sub voc.
    ‘Creditâ’ is here read for ‘creditam,’ as required by the
    order of the words.

[^22]: It is not certain to whom the Emperor’s letter was
    addressed. Some have thought that it was addressed to
    the Pretorian Prefect of Italy. Tillemont maintained
    that it was addressed to Valerian, Bishop of Aquileia, in
    whose see the Council was held. The language, though not
    decisive, seems in favour of the former supposition. In
    § 7. the Prefect of Italy is spoken of as issuing letters
    in pursuance of it.

[^23]: i. e. a copy of S. Paul’s Epistles.

[^24]: i. e. the Emperor’s letter.

[^25]: The text here seems defective, nor is there any thing
    to guide us to supply the lacuna. What is given in the
    translation is no more than a guess at the meaning of the
    sentence. The general connection is however clear enough
    even if it be omitted.

[^26]: The reading of Ed. Rom. is here adopted, as alone
    furnishing a reasonable sense. The Benedictine text is
    unintelligible.

[^27]: By Illyricum is here meant Illyricum Occidentale, which
    at this time was under the jurisdiction of the Vicarius
    Italiæ. (See the Table in Smith’s Gibbon, referred to in
    note[^21] p. 33.) Sirmium, which in the following Century
    was entirely destroyed by the Goths under Attila, was
    at this time a place of great importance both civil and
    ecclesiastical. It is spoken of by Justinian as capital of
    Illyricum both in civil and episcopal matters (Tillemont,
    note xv on the Life of S. Ambrose vol. x. p. 739). Its
    ecclesiastical importance is shewn by the contest in which
    S. Ambrose engaged with Justina, two years before the
    Council, 379 A. D. to bring about the election of Anemius
    as Bishop, when the Empress was using all her influence to
    cause an Arian Bishop to be appointed. Arianism had been
    rife there for some time, and Germinus a previous Bishop
    had been one of the leaders of that party. (Tillemont,
    S. Ambr. ch. xx.) Illyricum had been finally separated
    into two divisions, Orientale and Occidentale, by Gratian,
    in 379 A.D. who transferred the Eastern Division to
    Theodosius when he made him Emperor of the East, from
    which time it formed part of the Eastern Empire.
    (Tillemont, Hist. des Emp. vol. v. p. 716.)

[^28]: The context requires the reading ‘bonus’ for ‘omnibus,’
    which is that of one MS. The same MS. also inserts
    ‘Deum’ in Eusebius’ next speech, which is required by the
    argument.

[^29]: made Himself of no reputation E.T.

[^30]: But now ye seek to kill me, a man &c. E.V.

[^31]: By ‘tractatus concilii Nicæni’ is meant simply the
    Nicene Creed. This is established by S. Ambr. De Fide
    iii. 15. 125 (518 Ed. Ben.) where, speaking of the letter
    of Eusebius of Nicomedia read at the Council, in reference
    to the word ὁμοούσιος, he says, Hæc cum lecta esset
    epistola in Concilio Nicæno, hoc verbum _in tractatu fidei_
    posuerunt Patres, etc.

[^32]: The reading in Ed. Ben. is ‘carendum.’ If it is genuine,
    the word must have acquired a sort of transitive sense and
    have come to mean ‘to be deprived.’ No traces of such an
    use is to be found in Facciolati or in Ducange. Ed. Ben.
    quotes a parallel use of ‘abstinendus’ but without any
    instances. Rom. reads ‘privandum,’ Chifflet ‘curandum,’
    either of which give the required sense, but seem
    corrections without MS. authority.

[^33]: The text in this passage is defective and confused: but
    the general sense, as given here, may fairly be made out
    of it as it stands.

[^34]: It is to be noticed that the sentence of only twenty-five
    Bishops are here given out of thirty two or thirty three.
    It is probable therefore that the Record is defective, and
    that the sentences of the rest have been lost.

[^35]: Ed. Ben. here reads, Et cum Secundianus subripuisset. As
    subripuisset by itself could have no sense, the reading
    of Ed. Rom. has been adopted, Et cum Secundianus se
    paullulum subripuisset et postea convenisset. This is
    adopted in Tillemont’s narrative, Il sortit mesme de
    l’assemblée, mais il revint quelque temps après.

[^36]: This is according to the text of Ed. Rom.

[^37]: The abrupt termination of the discussion with Secundianus,
    without any account of a decision in his case, seems to
    point to the same conclusion as the incomplete list of
    Bishops who give sentence on Palladius, that the Record is
    defective. Moreover the unusual number of various readings
    is generally a sign of a defective text. The force and
    cleverness of the evasions of Secundianus seem sometimes
    to be lost thereby.

[^38]: With regard to the names of the sees, those of which
    the modern name is as familiar or more familiar than
    the ancient have been rendered by the modern name, those
    of which the modern name would be unfamiliar to general
    readers have been left in their ancient form. It would be
    affectation to call S. Ambrose Bishop of Mediolanum: on
    the other hand nothing would be gained by calling Felix
    Bishop of Jadera, Bishop of Zara.

[^39]: This name is omitted in the list at the beginning, so
    that there are thirty three in this list, only thirty
    two in the other. The two presbyters were probably
    representatives of Bishops, but it is not stated of whom.
