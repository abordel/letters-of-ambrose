# The Letter of Pope Siricius to the Church of Milan
**A.D. 389**

> THE Letter of Siricius was addressed to the Church of Milan to
> inform them of the sentence of excommunication passed against
> Jovinian and his followers. Jovinian had been a monk, but
> had abandoned the ascetic life and rushed into extremes of
> self-indulgence: there is a good description of him in Tillemont,
> (Vie de S. Ambr. 63, 64,) who calls him ‘cet Epicure des
> Chrétiens.’ The false doctrines with which he ‘barked at the
> true doctrines of the Church’ are stated in this Letter and
> in the reply of the Synod of the Church of Milan which follows.
> Jovinian was answered by S. Jerome, who writes against him with
> much vehemence.

1\. I WOULD fain always, beloved brethren, send you tidings of
joys, sincere as you are in love and peace, so that by means
of the mutual interchange of letters we might be pleased by the
tidings of your welfare[^211]. Our ancient Adversary however[^212]
does not suffer us to be free from his attacks, he who is a
liar from the beginning, the enemy of truth, envious of man, in
order to deceive whom he first deceived himself, the adversary
of chastity, the teacher of sensuality, who is fed by cruelty,
punished by abstinence, who hates fasts, asserting, as his
followers also give out, that they are superfluous, having no
hope of things to come, obnoxious to the censure of the Apostle,
_Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die_.

2\. O miserable boldness, O craft of a desperate mind! Already
was this unknown language of heresy spreading through the Church
like a cancer, seeking to fill the breast, and plunge the whole
man in destruction: and unless the Lord of Sabaoth had broken
through the snare which they had laid, the public exhibition
of so much evil and hypocrisy would have led to ruin the hearts
of many simple ones, for the human mind is easily drawn aside
towards evil, choosing rather to fly through open space, than to
travel with pain along the narrow way.

**S. Matt. vii. 15, 16.**
```

3\. Wherefore it was very necessary, most dearly beloved, to
commend what has been done here to your notice and consideration,
lest through the ignorance of any priest, the Church might
be infected by the contagion of these most wicked men who are
breaking in upon it under a religious pretext, as it is written
and the Lord has said, _Many come to you in sheeps’ clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves; ye shall know them by
their fruits_.

```{margin}
**Ps. xi. 2.**
```

These are they who under a mean garb boast themselves as
Christians, that walking under the semblance of piety they
may enter the house of prayer and utter the words of wily
disputation, _that they may privily shoot at them which are
true of heart_, and, seducing them from Catholic truth, may draw
them over, after the example of Satan, to the madness of their
own doctrines, beguiling the simplicity of the flock.

```{margin}
**S. Matt. xxii. 12.**
```

4\. And indeed from the times of the Apostles up to now we have
heard and known by experience of many malignant heresies, but
the sacred truth of the Church has never been assailed by the
barking of such dogs as those who have now suddenly broken
in upon us, with the doctrines of unbelief fully sprouted,
enemies of the faith; who by the fruit of their works have
betrayed whose disciples they are. For while other heretics
misunderstanding single points have proposed to bear away and
abstract from the Divine system of teaching, these men, _not
having on a wedding garment_, wound the Catholics, perverting,
as I have said, the continuity of the New and Old Testament, and
interpreting it in a diabolical spirit, have by their alluring
and false arguments already begun to ruin some Christians, and
to make them associates of their madness, not keeping within
themselves the poison of their iniquity: but some of their
chosen ones have betrayed their blasphemies by writing rash
discourse, which the rage of a desperate mind has led them
openly to publish, favouring, as it does, the cause of the
Heathens.

5\. But of their madness I suddenly received intelligence by
means of a shocking writing which certain faithful Christians,
men of high rank, and signal piety, caused to be conveyed to
me, unworthy as I am, in order that the opposition of these
men to the Divine Law might be detected by the discernment of
the Clergy and repressed by a spiritual sentence. Assuredly
we receive without scorn the vows of those marriages which we
assist at with the veil[^213], but virgins, for whose existence
marriage is necessary, as being devoted to God, we honour more
highly.

**Gal. i. 8.**

6\. Having therefore held an assembly of my clergy it became
clear that their sentiments were contrary to our doctrine, that
is, to the Christian law. Therefore, following the Apostolic
precept, we, seeing that they were _preaching another Gospel
than that which we received_, have excommunicated them. Know
therefore that it was the unanimous sentence of us all, as
well of the presbyters and deacons as of the other clergy, that
Jovinian, Auxentius, Genialis, Germinator, Felix, Prontinus[^214],
Martianus, Januarius, and Ingeniosus, who were discovered to
be the promoters of the new heresy and blasphemy, should be
condemned by the Divine sentence and our judgment, and remain
in perpetual exclusion from the Church.

7\. Nothing doubting that your Holiness will observe the
aforesaid decree, I have sent you this Epistle by my brethren
and fellow-priests, Crescens, Leopardus and Alexander, that
they, with a fervent spirit, may perform a religious and faithful
service.

[^211]: sospitatis indicio.

[^212]: This sentence as it stands in the text is incomplete, the
    ‘quia’ having no correlative. The ‘at vero quia’ seems
    like ‘at enim’ in Classical Latin, or perhaps the ‘quia’
    should be omitted.

[^213]: See Letter xix, 7. S. Ambrose in De Abraham B. 1. c. 9, 93
    alludes to the use of the veil in Christian marriages.

[^214]: This name appears in the reply of the Milan Synod as
    Plotinus, which is probably the true form.
