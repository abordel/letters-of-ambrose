# Letter LIV
**A.D. 392**

> THE Eusebius to whom this and the following letters are
> addressed is probably not the Bp. of Bologna who took a leading
> part in the Council of Aquileia, though he appears to be also
> connected with Bologna, (Lett. lv. 2.). S. Ambrose does not
> write to him in the style in which he would address an eminent
> Ecclesiastic. He was probably a layman, on very intimate terms
> with S. Ambrose, as the whole tone of the Letters implies. Both
> are on affairs of private life, both, especially the latter,
> are written in a tone of playful pleasantry and a not irreverent
> adaptation of sacred things, such as has often marked the
> familiar correspondence of a great Bishop.
>
> Eusebius seems to have had a son Faustinus, and this son a large
> family, of whom another Faustinus an Ambrosius and an Ambrosia
> are here mentioned. It was to this Eusebius, on the occasion
> of Ambrosia’s dedication as a professed Virgin, that S. Ambrose
> wrote the treatise ‘De Institutione Virginis.’ She is the
> ‘sancta soror,’ the ‘holy sister’ of Lett. liv.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO EUSEBIUS

1\. THE Secretary of the Prefecture, who had got into trouble on account
of the works at Portus[^236] is now safe in port. He came at the right
moment, for as soon as I received your letters I saw the Prefect, and
interceded for him; and he immediately pardoned him, and ordered the
letter which he had dictated for the sale of his goods to be recalled.
Even if his arrival had been less speedy, no man would more readily
have admitted the embarrassments attending that work of repairing the
port than he who would have made shipwreck therein had he not had you
for his pilot; and from whence he could otherwise only have escaped
with his bare life.

2\. The little Faustinus is suffering from a cough, and has come to
his holy sister to be cured, and came willingly, for he found that the
complaint of his stomach is better cared for here. He also considers
me to be a physician and looks to me for his dinner. So he has his
medicine here twice a day, and he had begun to get strong, but while
from their too great love they keep him away, his stomach-cough has
returned, worse than before, and unless he returns to his medicines
he will still suffer from it.

Farewell: love me, for I also love you.

[^236]: The adjective Portuensis generally refers to the town
    called Portus, which grew up in the times of the Emperors
    on the harbour of Ostia. It is probable therefore that the
    reference is to some work of which the person spoken of
    had the superintendence.
