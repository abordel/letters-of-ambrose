> A GRACEFUL letter of affection.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO HIS BROTHER CANDIDIANUS
```

1\. GREAT is the beauty of your language, but that of your love is
still more apparent, for your letters manifest to me the bright colours
of your mind, blessed and most dear brother. The Lord give you His
Grace and Blessing, for in your letters I recognize your good wishes
rather than my good deserts. For what merits of mine can equal such
commendations as yours?

Love me, my brother, for I love you.
