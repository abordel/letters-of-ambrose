# Letter XVII
**A.D. 384**

>  THIS letter was addressed to the Emperor Valentinian the 2nd
>  at the time when a deputation from the Senate at Rome, headed
>  by Symmachus, were seeking to obtain from him the restoration
>  of the statue and altar of Victory. The facts relating to
>  this statue form so important a page in the history of the
>  gradual suppression of paganism in the Empire, that it may be
>  well to give a brief outline of them, especially as this and
>  the following letter, and the ‘Memorial of Symmachus’ which
>  accompanies them, contain several allusions to them. Constantius
>  2nd, son of Constantine, when at Rome in 356 A.D., ordered the
>  statue of Victory which stood in the senate-house, ‘a majestic
>  female standing on a globe, with flowing garments, expanded
>  wings, and a crown of laurel in her outstretched hand’ (Gibbon,
>  ch. xxviii.) and the altar which stood before it, at which
>  the senators were sworn, to be removed, as an offence to the
>  Christians. The altar was restored by Julian, along with the
>  other disused symbols and rites of paganism. It was tolerated
>  by Valentinian 1st, who probably did not venture at once to
>  overthrow Julian’s work, (see Memorial of Symmachus § 7, 8)
>  though S. Ambrose (Lett. xvii. § 16) rhetorically represents him
>  as pleading that he was not aware of its being there, and that
>  no one had complained to him of its presence. It was once more
>  removed by Gratian, (see Lett. xvii. § 16.) The pagan party in
>  the Senate then made great efforts to procure its restoration.
>  Gibbon (ch. xxviii. note 13.) enumerates four successive
>  deputations sent by them with this object, ‘the first, A.D. 382,
>  to Gratian, who refused them audience, the second, A.D. 384,
>  to Valentinian, the third, A.D. 388, to Theodosius, the fourth,
>  A.D. 392, to Valentinian.’ The two letters of S. Ambrose and the
>  Memorial of Symmachus refer to the second of these deputations.
>  In this first one he presses on the Emperor his duty and
>  responsibility as a Christian Emperor, urges that the heathens
>  have deprived themselves of any equitable claim by their
>  persecution of the Christians in former times; asserts that the
>  petition is only that of a minority of the Senate, just as had
>  been the case years before, when they applied to Gratian. He
>  then asks for a copy of the Memorial, in order to answer it in
>  full, and warns Valentinian that he will find no Bishop to admit
>  him to any share in Christian worship if he inflicts this insult
>  on their faith, and reminds him of his brother and father, who
>  would rise from the grave to reproach him.
>
>  Though called Letters, these two documents are rather
>  state-papers. S. Ambrose himself in the latter speaks of the
>  former as a ‘libellus,’ the term usually applied to petitions
>  or memorials.

**Ps. xcvi. 5.**
```

1\. AS all who are under the dominion of Rome are enlisted to serve you,
the emperors and kings of the earth, so you yourselves are enlisted to
serve Almighty God and our holy Faith. For safety cannot be unperilled,
save when every man is a sincere worshipper of the true God, the God
of the Christians, who governs all things; for He is the only true God,
and is to be worshipped by the inmost spirit. _As for all the gods of
the heathen, they are but idols_, as the Scripture saith.

2\. Now he that is the soldier of this, the true God, and worships Him
in his inmost spirit, offers to Him no insincere or lukewarm service,
but a zealous faith and devotion. At any rate no one ought to give
his consent to the worship of idols and the observance of profane
ceremonies. For no man can deceive God, before Whom all the secrets of
the heart are manifest.

3\. Seeing then, most Christian Emperor, that not only faith, but the
very zeal and care and devotion of faith, is due from you to God, I
wonder how some men can have conceived the thought that it was your
duty to command the restoration of altars to the gods of the Gentiles,
and to bestow money for the purposes of profane sacrifices. For if you
give what has long been appropriated to the emperor’s privy purse or
the city treasury[^64], you will seem to be giving out of what is your
own rather than refunding to others what belongs to them.

4\. The men who now complain of their losses are those who never spared
our blood, and have even laid in ruins the very structures of our
Churches. The men who ask for privileges are they who denied to us by
the late law of Julian[^65] the common right of speaking and teaching,
privileges too whereby even Christians have often been deceived, for by
these means they sought to entrap some persons, either unawares or else
by the desire to avoid the burthen of public duties. And since all men
have not courage, many even under Christian Emperors have lapsed.

5\. Even had these things never been repeated, I could have proved
that your authority ought to have abolished them, but now that they
have been severally forbidden by many previous Emperors and abolished
at Rome in the interests of the true Faith by your Majesty’s brother
Gratian of illustrious memory, and abolished by a formal rescript,
do not, I beseech you, pluck up again these Christian ordinances,
nor rescind your brother’s injunctions. In civil matters, if ought
is decreed, no man considers that it should be overthrown, and shall
a religious precept be trampled on?

6\. Let no man beguile your youth; if he be a heathen who asks this of
you, let him not ensnare your mind in the bonds of his own superstition,
rather his very zeal ought to admonish you with what ardour you ought
to defend the true Faith, when he with all the warmth of truth defends
falsehood. I myself urge you to shew deference to the merits of
illustrious men; but it is certain that God ought to be obeyed above
all.

7\. When we have to consult on military matters we should look for
the opinion of one who is versed in war, and follow his counsel; when
we treat of religion God is to be considered. No man is injured by
Almighty God being preferred before him. He may keep his own opinion,
you do not constrain any man to worship against his will, and your
Majesty ought to have the same liberty, and every one should be content
to be unable to extort from the Emperor, what it would be a hardship
for the Emperor to desire to extort from him. The very heathen are wont
to be displeased by a double-minded man, for every man ought boldly to
defend the faith of his own heart, and to maintain his purpose.

8\. But if any who call themselves Christians conceive that you
should make such a decree, let not bare words affect your mind, let
not idle names deceive you. Whoever persuades to this, or decrees
it, offers sacrifice to the gods. Yet it is more tolerable that one
should sacrifice than that all should fall. Here the whole Senate of
Christians is in danger.

9\. If at the present day, (which God forbid) an heathen Emperor were
to erect an altar to false gods, and compel the Christians to assemble
there, in order for them to be present at the sacrifice, so that the
breath and mouth of the faithful might be tainted with ashes from
the altar, with sparks from the sacrilege, with smoke from the pile,
and should force them to vote in a house in which the members were
sworn at the altar of an idol, (for on this account it is that they
maintain that an altar should be set up, namely, that every one should
consult for the public weal, under the obligation of what they consider
its sanctity, although the majority of the Senate now consists of
Christians,) if this, I say, were the case, Christians would consider
themselves persecuted, if they were compelled by such an alternative to
come to the assembly, and indeed it is often by violence that they are
compelled to come: shall Christians then in _your_ reign be compelled
to swear on the altar? What is an oath, but an acknowledgement of the
divine power of him whom you call upon to attest your truthfulness? Is
it in _your_ reign that the request and demand is made, that you bid an
altar to be erected, and money expended on profane sacrifices?

10\. But this cannot be decreed without sacrilege, and so I beg you not
to decree or order it, nor to subscribe any such decree. I appeal to
your faith as a minister of Christ; all the Bishops would have appealed
with me, had not this report which has reached men’s ears that such a
thing was either propounded in your Council or petitioned for by the
Senate, been so sudden and incredible. But let it not be said that the
Senate have petitioned for this; a few heathen have usurped the name of
all. For nearly two years ago on an attempt of this kind, holy Damasus
the Bishop of the Roman Church, chosen by the judgment of God, sent me
a document which the Christian senators in large numbers had presented,
declaring that they gave no commission of the sort, that they did not
agree or consent to such petitions of the heathen, and they threatened
that they would not come either publicly or privately to the Senate
if such a decree was made. Is it worthy of your reign, that is of a
Christian reign, that Christian senators should be deprived of their
dignity, that the profane wishes of the heathen may be carried into
effect? This document I sent to your Majesty’s brother[^66], and it
proves that the Senate gave no commission to the deputies about the
expenses of superstition.

11\. But perhaps it may be said, Why then were they not present in
the Senate, when these things were brought forward? They say plainly
enough what they wish, by not being present; they have said enough in
addressing your Majesty. And yet we need not wonder if they who will
not concede to your Majesty the liberty of refusing to command that
which you do not approve, or of maintaining your own opinion, should
deprive private men at Rome of the right of resistance.

12\. Remembering then the commission so lately laid upon me, I again
appeal your own faith, I appeal to your own sentiments, not to give
your answer in accordance with this heathen petition, or sign your name
to such an answer, for it would be sacrilegious. Consult him who is
your Excellency’s father, the Emperor Theodosius, to whom you have been
wont to refer in all causes of importance; and nothing can be graver
than religion, more exalted than faith.

13\. Were this a civil matter, the right of reply would be reserved
for the opposing party: it is a matter of religion, and I, as Bishop,
appeal to you, I request to be furnished with a copy of the Memorial
which has been sent, that I may answer more at large; and so let
your Majesty’s father be consulted on the whole matter and vouchsafe
a gracious answer. Assuredly should the decree be different, we as
Bishops cannot quietly permit and connive at it; it will indeed be in
your power to come to the Church, but there you will either not find a
priest, or you will find one purposed to resist.

**S. Luke xvi. 13.**
```

14\. What answer will you give to the priest when he says to you,
‘the Church seeks not your gifts, because you have adorned the heathen
temples with gifts; the Altar of Christ rejects your gifts, because
you have erected altars to idols, for it was your word, your hand, your
signature, your act: the Lord Jesus refuses and repels your service,
because you have served idols, for He has said to you, _Ye cannot serve
two masters_? The Virgins dedicated to God enjoy no privileges from you,
and do the vestal Virgins claim them? What do you want of the priests
of God, when you have preferred to them the profane petitions of the
heathen? We cannot enter into fellowship with the errors of others.’

15\. What will you answer to this charge? That it is a boyish error?
Every age is perfect in Christ, and fulfilled with God. No childhood in
faith can be admitted; for children confronted with their persecutors
have boldly confessed Christ.

16\. What answer will you make to your brother? Will he not say to
you, ‘I would not believe myself conquered, for I left you Emperor,
I regretted not to die, because you were my successor, I grieved not
that I was withdrawn from power, because I believed that my edicts,
specially those concerning religion, would continue for ever. These
were the memorials of piety and virtue which I had erected, these
trophies of victory over the world, these the spoils of the devil,
of the adversary of all, which I had offered up, and in which lies
eternal victory. What more could an enemy have deprived me of? You have
abrogated my decrees; an act which even he who took up arms against
me[^67] has not yet committed. Now am I pierced with a more deadly
weapon, in that my brother has annulled my ordinances. Your acts tend
to the injury of my better part, for while the one destroys my body
the other destroys my good name. Now are my laws repealed, repealed too
(which makes it more painful) by your adherents and by mine; that very
thing which even my enemies had praised in me is repealed. If you have
willingly acquiesced, you have condemned the Faith which I held, if you
have yielded reluctantly, you have betrayed your own. And so, what is a
still heavier calamity, I incur danger in your person also.’

17\. What answer will you make to your father[^68], who with still
greater grief will address you, saying: ‘You have judged very wrongly
of me, my son, in supposing that I could have winked at the heathen.
No man ever informed me that there was an altar in the Roman Senate
house[^69]; never could I have believed such a crime as that heathen
sacrifices should be performed in that common council of Christians
and heathens, that is to say, that the heathen should triumph in the
presence of Christians, and Christians should be compelled against
their wills to be present at sacrifices. Many and various were the
crimes committed during my reign, those that were discovered I punished,
and if any man escaped unnoticed, is it just to say that I approved
that which no one informed me of? You have judged most wrongly of
me, if you suppose that a foreign superstition and not my own faith
preserved to me the empire.’

18\. Wherefore, your Majesty, seeing that if you make any such decree,
you will injure, first God, and next your father and brother, I beseech
you to do that which you know will be profitable to your salvation in
the sight of God.

[^64]: ‘fisco vel arcæ.’ The ‘fiscus,’ or imperial treasury,
    received whatever was assigned to the Emperor individually,
    as distinguished from the ‘aerarium,’ which received what
    belonged to the senate, as representing the old republica:
    ‘arca’ is sometimes used in late writers as equivalent to
    ‘fiscus,’ sometimes, when distinguished from it, as here,
    it signifies the city funds, which were distinct from both.

[^65]: Julian’s edict, forbidding the Christians to teach in
    the schools of grammar and rhetoric, is mentioned with
    disapproval by Gibbon ch. xxiii.

[^66]: i. e. his half brother Gratian.

[^67]: i. e. Maximus.

[^68]: Valentinian the 1st.

[^69]: This is sometimes represented as an exaggerated piece
    of rhetoric on S. Ambrose’s part, not to be regarded as
    representing a real truth: but it may very well do so, for
    Valentinian was almost constantly occupied with wars on
    the frontiers of the empire, and it does not appear from
    his life that he was ever at Rome during his reign. Milan,
    not Rome, was the chief seat of the Western Emperors at
    this time, when they were not with their armies.
