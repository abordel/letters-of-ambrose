# Letter XV
**A.D. 383**

> THIS letter is addressed to the Bishops of Macedonia, in
> reply to their announcement of the death of Acholius[^61],
> Bishop of Thessalonica. S. Ambrose pronounces a warm eulogium
> on the departed Bishop, whom he compares to Elijah, especially
> in leaving in Anysius a successor, like Elisha, endowed with

```{centered} AMBROSE TO ANATOLIUS, NUMERIUS, SEVERUS, PHILIP, MACEDONIUS, AMMIANUS, THEODOSIUS, EUTROPIUS, CLARUS, EUSEBIUS, AND TIMOTHEUS, PRIESTS OF THE LORD, AND TO ALL THE BELOVED CLERGY AND PEOPLE OF THESSALONICA, HEALTH
```

1\. WHILE longing to keep ever imprinted on my mind the holy man, and
while I survey all his acts like one set on a watch-tower, my restless
anxiety caused me to drink only too swiftly these bitter tidings, and
I learned what I had rather still be ignorant of, that the man whom we
were seeking on earth was already at rest in heaven.

2\. You will ask who announced this to me, seeing that the letter of
your Holinesses had not then arrived. I know not who was the bearer of
the tidings: it is, you know, men’s wont not willingly to remember the
bearer of tidings of sorrow: however, though the sea was then closed,
and the land blocked by a barbarian invasion, there was no lack of a
messenger, though it was impossible for any one to arrive from abroad;
so that it appears to me the saint himself announced his own death to
us, for now that he enjoyed the eternal recompense of his labours, and
freed from the bands of the body, had been carried by the ministry of
Angels to the intimate presence of Christ, he was desirous of removing
the error of one who loved him, that we might not be asking for him
length of mortal life, while he was already receiving eternal rewards.

3\. This veteran then of Christ Jesus is not dead, but has departed and
left us, he has changed for heaven this earth below, and clapping the
pinions and wings of his spirit he exclaims, _Lo, I have got me away
far off!_ For in the spirit of the Apostle he desired long ago to leave
the earth, but he was detained by the prayers of all, as we read of
the Apostle, because it was needful for the Church that he should abide
longer in the flesh. For he lived not for himself but for all, and was
to the people the minister of eternal life, so that he gained the fruit
thereof in others, before he experienced it in himself.

4\. Now therefore he is a citizen of heaven, a possessor of that eternal
city Jerusalem, which is in heaven. There he sees the boundless circuit
of this city, its pure gold, its precious stones, its perpetual light
though without the sun. And seeing all these things whereof he before
had knowledge, but which are now manifested to him face to face, he
says, _Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord
of hosts, in the city of our God_. Standing there he appeals to the
people of God saying, _O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how
large is the place of His possession!_ Great is He, and hath none end.

5\. But what is this? While I consider his merits, and follow as it
were in spirit his departure, and mingle with the choirs of saints that
escort him, not indeed by my desert but by my affection, meanwhile I
have almost forgotten myself. Is then this wall of faith and grace and
sanctity taken from us, that wall which, though frequently assaulted
by the Goths[^62], their barbarian darts could never penetrate, nor the
warlike fury of many nations overpower? They who in other places were
spoilers there prayed for peace, and while they marvelled what was this
unarmed force which opposed them, the wiser hinted that one like Elisha
dwelt within, one who was nearly his equal in age, in spirit quite his
equal, and bade them beware lest after the manner of the Syrian army,
blindness should fall on them also.

6\. However the gifts of Christ to His disciples are various. Elisha
led captive into Samaria the army of the Syrians, holy Acholius by his
prayers caused the victors to retreat from Macedonia. Do we not see
in this a proof of supernatural forces, that though no soldiers were
at hand, the victors should thus fly without a foe; is not this too
a proof of blindness that they should fly when no man pursued? Though
in truth holy Acholius pursued and fought them, not with swords but
prayers, not with weapons but good works.

```

7\. Do we not know that the saints fight even when they keep holiday?
Was not Elisha at rest? Yes, at rest in body, but in spirit he was
active, and by his prayers he fought when the noise of horses and the
noise of a great host were heard in the camp of the Syrians, so that
they thought that the forces of other princes were marching against
them, to succour the people of Israel. So they were seized with great
panic and fled, and four lepers, who had gone out to seek for death,
spoiled their camp. And did not the Lord work like, or, I might almost
say, greater wisdom in Macedonia, by the prayers of Acholius? For it
was not by an idle panic nor a vague suspicion, but by a raging plague
and burning pestilence that the Goths were troubled and alarmed. In
short they then fled that they might escape; afterwards they returned
and sued for peace to save their lives.

8\. Wherefore in the great deeds of this eminent man we have seen
former ages revived, and have witnessed those works of the prophet
which we read of. Like Elisha he was all his life in the midst of
arms and battles, and by his good works made wars to cease. And when
tranquillity was restored to his countrymen, he breathed out his holy
soul, a misfortune heavier than war itself. Like Elijah he was carried
up to heaven, not in a chariot of fire, nor by horses of fire, (unless
haply it was but that we saw them not) nor in any whirlwind in the sky,
but by the will and in the calm of our God, and with the jubilation of
the holy Angels who rejoiced that such a man had come among them.

9\. Surely we cannot doubt this, when all other particulars agree so
well. For at the very moment when he was being taken up, he let fall so
to speak the vestment which he wore, and invested with it holy Anysius
his disciple, and clothed him with the robes of his own priesthood.
His merits and graces I do not now hear for the first time, nor have I
first learnt them from your letters, but I recognised them in what you
wrote. For as if foreknowing that he would be his successor, Acholius
designated him as such by tokens, though in open speech he concealed
it; saying that he had been aided by his care, labour, and ministry,
thus seeming to declare him his coadjutor, one who would not come as a
novice to the chief office of the priesthood, but as a tried performer
of its duties. Well does that saying in the Gospel befit him, _Well
done, thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a
few things, I will make thee ruler over many things_.

```

10\. So far both you and I participate in holy Acholius, but there is
this special bond between him and me, that the man of blessed memory
suffered me to become his friend. For on his arrival in Italy, when
I was prevented by illness from going to meet him, he himself came
and visited me. With what ardour, with what affection did we embrace
each other! With what groans did we lament the evil of the times, and
all that was happening here! Our garments were bedewed with a flood of
tears, while in the enjoyment of our meeting long and mutually desired,
we remained locked in each others embrace. Thus what I had long yearned
for he bestowed, the opportunity of seeing him. For although it is in
the spirit, the seat of love, that the greater portion and more perfect
knowledge lies, yet we desire to behold our friends in bodily form also.
Thus formerly the kings of the earth sought to behold the face of
Solomon, and to hear his wisdom.

11\. He is gone then from us, and has left us tossed on this sea; what
is a benefit to him is to the many a heavier calamity than even the
rage of the barbarians; for this he repelled, and now who shall bring
back his presence to us? Nay, the Lord brings it back, and he himself
gives himself back in his disciple. Your judgements give him back,
by which you say, _Give to Levi his manifest one, and his truths to
Thy holy one_. You have given _his manifest one_ inasmuch as he is
established by his appointment; you have given a follower of that
man, _who said unto his father and to his mother I have not seen thee;
neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children. He
observed the word of the Lord, and kept His covenant. The people will
tell of his wisdom._

12\. Such was the man’s life, such his heritage, such his conversation,
such his succession. While yet a boy he entered a monastery, and
though shut up in a narrow cell in Achaia, yet by grace he traversed
the spaces of many countries. The people of Macedonia besought that
he might be their Bishop, the priesthood elected him to that office,
that where the faith had before been maimed[^63] by the Bishop, there
afterwards the solid foundations of the faith might be established by
the Bishop.

13\. None other did his disciple imitate, who also himself _said unto
his father and to his mother I have not seen thee_. He saw them not
with affection, he saw them not with desire, and he knew not his
brethren, because he desired to know the Lord. He observed also the
word of the Lord and kept His covenant, and will ever offer sacrifice
upon His altar. Bless, O Lord, his faith, his holiness, his assiduity.
Let Thy blessing descend upon his head and upon his neck. Let him be
honourable among his brethren, let him be as the leader of the herd.
Let him sift the hearts of his enemies, let him soothe the minds of the
saints, and let the judgement of Thy priests flourish in him as a lily.
Brethren, farewell, and love me, as I love you.

[^61]: Acholius, or Ascholius, as he is called by Socrates, was
    the Bishop who baptised Theodosius, during an illness
    which seized him on a campaign against the Goths. He was
    present at the Council of Constantinople, and afterwards
    at that of Rome, not as one of the deputies from the
    East, but probably because his see had been so recently
    transferred to the Eastern Empire, that he might seem to
    belong to both East and West. (Tillemont Ambr. ch. xxxi.)
    It was there that he met S. Ambrose, who had gone to Rome
    to attend the Council, and had fallen ill. His death must
    have occurred in A.D. 383, for his successor Anysius was
    Bishop before the death of Damasus, Bishop of Rome, who
    died in A.D. 384. Theodoret therefore (B. v. ch. 18.) must
    be wrong in making him the Bishop who wrote to S. Ambrose
    an account of the massacre at Thessalonica, which occurred
    in A.D. 390. But the passage of Theodoret occurs in only
    one MS., and is perhaps not genuine.

[^62]: The Goths had been settled within the boundaries of the
    Empire by Valens in A.D. 376, when they implored his
    protection against the Huns. He established them in Moesia,
    where they soon revolted, and ravaged Thrace, uniting
    with their former enemies, the Huns, and other barbarians.
    Valens was defeated and slain by them in A.D. 378, and
    then they overran all the neighbouring provinces. There is
    a graphic account in Gibbon, ch. xxvi.

[^63]: The Benedictine text here reads ‘claudebatur.’ Several MSS.,
    as the editors mention in a note, have ‘claudebat.’ They
    themselves suggest ‘claudicabat.’ But ‘claudebat’ really
    gives the same meaning, and there seems little doubt that
    it is the true reading. It comes from claudeo or claudo,
    (for both forms are to be found,) meaning ‘to be lame,’
    ‘to halt.’ It occurs three times in Cicero.
