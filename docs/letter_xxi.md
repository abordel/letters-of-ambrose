```{centered} TO THE MOST CLEMENT EMPEROR, HIS BLESSED MAJESTY VALENTINIAN, AMBROSE, BISHOP, SENDS GREETING
```

1\. DALMATIUS the tribune and notary cited me at your Clemency’s bidding,
as he alleged, requiring that I also should choose umpires as Auxentius
had done. He did not mention the names of those who had been called
for, but he added that the trial would take place in the Consistory,
and that your pious judgment would decide between us.

2\. To this I make, as I consider, a sufficient answer. No one ought
to deem me contumacious for asserting what your father of illustrious
memory not only declared by word of mouth[^108] but sanctioned by his
laws; that in a matter of the Faith or of any ecclesiastical ordinance,
the judges ought to be qualified for it, both competent by office and
qualified by profession: (these are the words of the Rescript), that is
to say, he would have Bishops judge Bishops. Moreover if a bishop were
accused elsewhere also, and a charge of a moral nature to be examined,
this too he willed should be referred to the judgment of Bishops.

3\. Who then is it who makes a contumacious answer to your Clemency?
He who would have you like your Father, or he who would have you
unlike? Unless perhaps some persons count cheaply the opinion of that
great Emperor, whose faith has been approved by the constancy of his
confession[^109], and his wisdom proclaimed by the improved condition
of the State.

4\. When have you ever heard, most gracious Emperor, that laymen
had judged a Bishop in a matter pertaining to the Faith? Does
their flattery make us cringe so low as to forget the rights of the
priesthood, and suppose that what God has committed to me I should
entrust to others? If a layman may teach a Bishop, what will follow?
a layman will dispute, and a Bishop listen, a Bishop learn of a layman.
Assuredly, if we revert to the volume of Holy Scripture or to the
time of old, who is there who will deny that in a cause of the Faith,
in a cause, I say, of the Faith, Bishops are wont to judge Christian
Emperors, not Emperors to judge Bishops.

5\. Hereafter, you will, by God’s favour, reach a more mature age, and
then you will judge what kind of Bishop he must be who submits the
rights of the priesthood to laymen. Your father, who by God’s favour
attained a riper age, used to say: ‘It is not for me to judge between
Bishops:’ your Majesty now says, ‘I ought to judge.’ He, although
baptized into Christ, considered himself unequal to the weight of
so important a judgment; does your Majesty, who have yet to earn for
yourself the Sacrament of Baptism, claim to decide concerning the Faith,
although still ignorant of the Sacrament of this Faith?

6\. But what sort of judges he will have selected we may leave to be
guessed, seeing that he fears to disclose their names. Let them come
openly, if indeed there be any, to the Church; let them attend together
with the people, not to sit as judges, but for every one to prove his
own feelings and choose whom he will follow. The cause is concerning
the Bishop of that Church; if the people hear him and suppose he has
the better of the argument, let them follow his Faith; I shall not be
jealous.

7\. I forbear to mention that the people themselves have already
decided; I do not urge that the Bishop[^110] whom they have they
demanded from your Majesty’s father; I urge not that your father
promised tranquillity for the future if he, having been elected, took
upon him the Bishopric. It was in reliance on these promises that I
acted.

8\. But if he prides himself on the support of any foreigners let him
be Bishop in the place whence those come who hold that he should be
invested with the name of a Bishop. For I neither acknowledge him as
Bishop, nor know whence he comes.

9\. How, your Majesty, can we be said to settle a matter in which you
have already declared your judgment; nay, have yourself published laws
precluding others from deciding otherwise. And when you laid down this
rule for others you laid it down also for yourself; for the laws which
the Emperor makes he ought to be the first to keep. Would you then have
me make trial whether those who are chosen judges will meet, contrary
to your decree, or whether they will allege that they have not been
able to contravene so rigid and peremptory a command of the Emperor?

10\. But this is the part of a contumacious not of a respectful Bishop.
See, your Majesty, how you yourself partially rescind your own law; but
I would that you would do so not partially but universally, for I would
not wish your law to be above the law of God. The law of God has taught
us what we should follow, human laws cannot teach us this. They can
compel a change in the timid, but they cannot inspire faith.

11\. Who therefore when he learns that in one moment it has been
published through so many provinces that whoever shall resist the
Emperor shall be put to death, whoever shall not give up the temple of
God shall immediately be slain; who is there, I say, who either alone
or with a few others can say to the Emperor; ‘I do not approve your
law?’ The priesthood are not allowed to say this; are then the laity
allowed? And shall he judge concerning the faith, who either hopes for
favour or fears giving offence?

12\. Lastly, shall I venture to nominate laymen for umpires, who if they
keep true to their Faith must be proscribed or put to death, as that
law passed concerning the Faith prescribes. Shall I then expose them to
the hazard either of prevarication or of punishment?

13\. Ambrose is not of such importance as to degrade the priesthood on
his account. One man’s life is not of as much value as the dignity of
the whole priesthood, by whose advice I gave my direction when they
suggested that there might be some heathen or Jew, chosen by Auxentius,
to whom we might give a triumph over Christ if we committed to him
judgment concerning Christ. What else pleases them but to hear of wrong
done to Christ? What else can please them but the denial (which God
forbid) of the Divinity of Christ? Clearly they agree entirely with
the Arian, who calls Christ a creature, which heathens and Jews too
are willing enough to confess.

14\. This was decreed at the synod of Ariminum, and with good reason
do I abhor that Council; following as I do the doctrine of the Nicene
Council, from which neither death nor the sword can ever separate me.
This Faith your Majesty’s father, the blessed Emperor Theodosius, both
followed and approved. This Faith the provinces of Gaul and of Spain
hold, and this they keep with the pious confession of the Divine Spirit.

15\. If I have to preach, I have learnt to preach in the Church, as
my predecessors did. If a conference is to be held on a matter of
Faith, it ought to be a conference of Bishops, as was the case under
Constantine of august memory, who laid down no laws beforehand, but
left to the Bishops the liberty of judging. The same was the case also
under Constantius of illustrious memory, who inherited his father’s
dignity, but what began well ended badly. For the Bishops had at first
subscribed an orthodox confession, but, through the wish of certain
persons to judge of the Faith in agreement with the palace, the result
was that these judgments of the Bishops were fraudulently changed; they
however immediately recalled this perverted decision. And there is no
doubt that the majority at Ariminum approved the creed of the Nicene
Council[^111] and condemned the Arian decrees.

16\. If Auxentius appeals to a Synod to discuss questions concerning the
Faith, though it would be needless to disturb so many Bishops on one
person’s account, who, were he an Angel from heaven, ought not to be
preferred to the Church’s peace, I too will not be absent when I hear
that the Synod is assembled. Let the law then be repealed, if you would
have the contest entered upon.

17\. I would have come to your Majesty’s Consistory, to offer this plea
in your presence, could I have obtained leave from the Bishops or the
people; but they said that an argument concerning the Faith ought to be
held in the Church in the presence of the people.

18\. I could have wished that your Majesty had not declared that I might
go into exile, whither I chose. I went abroad daily, no man guarded me.
You should then have sent me wherever you thought fit, for I was ready
to submit to any thing; now the Bishops say to me, ‘There is little
difference between voluntarily leaving Christ’s altar and betraying it,
for if you leave you will betray it.’

19\. And I would I were certain that the Church would not be given up to
the Arians, I would then willingly surrender myself to your Majesty’s
disposal. But if it is I only who am an intruder, why has the command
been given to invade all other Churches also? I would it were certain,
that no one would disturb the Churches, I would gladly then have any
sentence which seems good passed concerning myself.

20\. Let your Majesty then be pleased graciously to accept my reasons
for not coming to the Church. I have not learned how to stand up in the
Consistory except in your behalf[^112]; and within the palace I cannot
contend, for I neither seek after nor know the secrets of the palace.

21\. I, Bishop Ambrose, offer this remonstrance to the most clement
Emperor, his blessed Majesty Valentinian.

[^108]: A reply of Valentinian the 1st to some Bishops of the
    Hellespont and Bithynia, who demanded permission to meet
    ‘to amend the doctrine of the faith,’ is given by Sozomen.
    (vi. 7.) His words are, ‘It is not lawful for me, as a
    layman, to busy myself about such matters as these: let
    the Bishops, whose business it is, meet by themselves
    wherever they will.’ To the same effect are the words of
    his which Theodoret reports, (iv. 6.) when bidding the
    Bishops of the province elect a successor to Auxentius.
    He bids them choose a fit person, ‘that we also, who rule
    the empire, may sincerely bow our heads to him, and welcome
    his reproofs, (for, being men, we cannot but stumble,)
    as a remedial discipline.’ What law is referred to is
    uncertain. The Benedictine Editors, after mentioning some
    which had been suggested ‘think it more probable that the
    law referred to is not extant.’

[^109]: Gibbon (ch. xxv.) in his character of Valentinian says,
    ‘In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace
    by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the
    reigning religion.’ The story is told by Theod. Eccles.
    Hist. iii. 16. Valentinian was in official attendance
    on the Emperor Julian on one occasion when he went to the
    temple of Fortune to perform rites. ‘On either side of the
    door were stationed attendants, who sprinkled all who came
    in with lustral water to purify them, as they believed.
    When some of the drops fell on his cloak, Valentinian
    struck the attendants with his fist, saying that he was
    defiled not purified by them.’ For this he was dismissed
    from the court, and sent to a solitary garrison. The same
    story is told with slight variations by Sozomen. Hist. vi. 6.

[^110]: He is alluding to his own election.

[^111]: This is true of the first decision of the Council, but as
    S. Ambrose says, ‘it ended badly,’ for the Bishops were
    inveigled into accepting a less orthodox formula. See Prof.
    Bright’s Hist. p. 94, 98.

[^112]: S. Ambrose here delicately alludes to the service he had
    rendered to Valentinian in going on his behalf to the
    court of the usurper Maximus after the death of Gratian,
    which is referred to in Letter xxiv.
