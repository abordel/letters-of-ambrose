```{centered} TO THE MOST GRACIOUS PRINCE AND BLESSED EMPEROR HIS MAJESTY THEODOSIUS, BISHOP AMBROSE SENDS GREETING
```

1\. NEARLY incessant are the cares which harass me, most excellent
Emperor, but never was I in such trouble as at present; for I see I
must be on my guard against the danger even of a charge of sacrilege.
Wherefore I beseech you patiently to hear my address. For if I am
unworthy to be heard by you, I am unworthy to offer for you, or to have
your vows and prayers intrusted to me. Will you not hear him whom you
wish to be heard in your behalf? Will you not hear him pleading for
himself whom you have heard when pleading for others? Will you not
dread the consequences of your own judgment; and fear to render him
unworthy to be heard in your behalf, by treating him as unworthy of
a hearing from you.

2\. But it is neither the part of an Emperor to deny liberty of speech,
nor of a Bishop not to utter what he thinks. There is no quality more
amiable and popular in an Emperor than to cherish freedom even in those
who owe him military allegiance. For there is this difference between
good and bad rulers, that the good love freedom, the bad slavery.
And there is nothing in a Bishop so offensive in God’s sight, or so
base before men, as not freely to declare his opinions. For it is
written, _I spake of Thy testimonies also even before kings, and was
not ashamed_, and in another place, _Son of man, I have made thee
a watchman unto the house of Israel; with the intent_, it proceeds,
_that if the righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit
iniquity, because thou hast not given him warning_[^193] that is, hast
not told him what to beware of, _his righteousness which he hath done
shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin
not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned;
also thou shalt deliver thy soul._

**2 Tim. iv. 2.**
```

3\. I prefer then, to have fellowship with your Majesty in good rather
than in evil; and therefore the silence of a Bishop ought to be
displeasing to your Clemency, and his freedom pleasing. For you will be
implicated in the danger of my silence, you will share in the benefits
of my outspokenness. I am not then an officious meddler in matters
beyond my province, an intruder in the concerns of others, but I comply
with my duty, I obey the commandment of our God. This I do chiefly from
love and regard to you, and from a wish to preserve your well-being.
But if I am not believed, or am forbidden to act on this motive, then
in truth I speak from fear of offending God. For if my own danger
could deliver you, I would consent to be offered for you, though not
willingly, for I would rather that without danger to myself you should
be accepted and glorified by God. But if I am to suffer under the
charge of silence and dissimulation without effecting your exculpation
I had rather you should deem me too importunate than useless or
mercenary. For it is written, in the words of the holy Apostle Paul,
whose teaching you cannot gainsay, _Be instant in season, out of season:
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine_.

```{margin}
**S. Matt. x. 19, 20.**
```

4\. We then also have One Whom it is even more dangerous to displease;
especially as even Emperors themselves are not offended with any man
for fulfilling his function, but you patiently give ear to every one
speaking concerning his own department, nay you reprove him for not
acting in accordance with his line of duty. Can that then which you
readily accept from your soldiers, seem to you offensive in a Bishop;
seeing that we speak not according to our own wills, but as we are
commanded? For you know that it is written, _when ye shall be brought
before governors and kings take no thought how or what ye shall speak,
for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For
it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father Which speaketh
in you._ Were it in civil causes that I had to speak, my not obtaining
an audience would not give me such apprehension, although even then
justice ought to be observed, but in God’s cause whom will you hear,
if you hear not the Bishop, at whose great peril it is that sin is
committed? Who will dare to tell you the truth, if a Bishop does not?

**S. Matt. xviii. 15–17.**
```

5\. I know that you are pious, merciful, meek and gentle, having at
heart the faith and fear of the Lord; but some failings oftentimes
escape our notice. Some men _have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge_, and we ought, I think, to beware lest this steal even over
faithful souls. I know your piety towards God, your lenity towards men;
I am myself indebted to your courtesy for many benefits. Wherefore I
feel greater fear, and deeper solicitude lest even your own judgment
should hereafter condemn me for having failed, through cowardice or
flattery, in saving you from a fall. If I had seen you sin against
myself, I ought not to have kept silence, for it is written, _If thy
brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault; then
rebuke him before two or three witnesses, and if he shall neglect to
hear them, tell it unto the Church_. Shall I then be silent in the
cause of God? Now then let us consider what it is I have to apprehend.

6\. The military Count of the East[^194] reported that a synagogue had
been burnt, and that this had been done at the instigation of the
Bishop. You decided that the others should be punished, and that the
synagogue should be rebuilt by the Bishop himself. I will not insist
on the propriety of calling for the Bishop’s own statement; for the
clergy are wont to check disturbances and desirous of peace, save when
they are themselves moved by some offence against God or insult to the
Church. But suppose this Bishop to have been too eager in setting fire
to this synagogue, and now to grow timid before the judgment-seat, has
your Majesty no fear, lest he should acquiesce in your sentence, no
apprehension of his becoming apostate?

7\. Do you not fear, what will certainly be the case, that he will meet
your officer with a refusal; and so he will be obliged to make him
either an apostate or a martyr, and both of these are adverse to your
interests and savour of persecution, that he should be forced either
to become an apostate or undergo martyrdom. You see then whereunto this
matter tends; if you think the Bishop firm, avoid driving his firmness
to martyrdom; if you think him frail, shun exposing his frailty to a
fall. For a heavy responsibility lies on him who has caused one who is
weak to fall.

8\. Under these circumstances I suppose that the Bishop will say that
he himself kindled the fire, gathered the crowd, collected the people;
so as not to lose an opportunity of martyrdom, and in place of the weak
to offer up a bolder victim. O happy falsehood; obtaining for others
acquittal, for himself Grace. This is my request also to your Majesty,
that you would turn your vengeance upon me, and, if you consider this a
crime, impute it to me. Why do you order the absent to be punished? you
have the guilty person before you, you hear his confession, I openly
affirm that I myself set the synagogue on fire, or at least, that I
ordered others to do so; that there might be no place in which Christ
is denied. And if it be objected, why did I not set it on fire in this
very city? It began to be burnt, I reply, by the Divine judgment, my
work was superseded. And to speak the truth, I was the less zealous
because I expected no punishment. Why should I do that which being
unavenged would also be unrewarded? These words are a shock to modesty,
but they also bring back grace; they provide against the commission of
that which may offend Almighty God.

9\. But suppose that no one will cite the Bishop to do this; for this
is what I have begged of your Clemency, and though I have not yet read
that the edict is revoked, I will nevertheless assume it to be so.
But what if other more timid persons, from a fear of death offer to
rebuild the synagogue from their own funds, or the Count, finding this
previously ordained, should himself command it to be restored at the
expense of the Christians? Your Majesty will then have an apostate
Count, and you will entrust your victorious banner, your labarum, which
is consecrated by the name of Christ, to one who is the restorer of
the synagogue which knows not Christ. Command the labarum to be carried
into the synagogue, and let us see if they do not resist.

10\. Shall then a building be raised for perfidious Jews out of the
spoils of the Church, and shall that patrimony, which by Christ’s mercy
has been assigned to Christians, be transferred to the temples of the
unbelieving? We read that temples were in former days erected from the
spoils of the Cimbri and other enemies of Rome. Shall the Jews inscribe
this title on the front of their synagogue: ‘The temples of impiety
built from the spoils of Christians?’

11\. But the maintenance of discipline is perhaps what influences your
Majesty. Is the show of discipline then weightier than the cause of
religion? Police should give place to religion.

12\. Has your Majesty never heard that when Julian commanded the temple
at Jerusalem to be restored, they who cleared away the rubbish were
destroyed by fire from heaven? Are you not afraid lest this should now
happen? Surely you ought not to have commanded what Julian commanded.

13\. But why are you thus moved? Is it generally because a public
building has been burnt, or because it is a synagogue? If you are moved
by the conflagration of the meanest edifice, (and what else could there
have been in so obscure a town,) does not your Majesty remember how
many prefects’ houses have been burnt at Rome, and yet no man enacted
vengeance for them? Nay, if any Emperor had desired to punish such an
act severely, he would rather have injured the cause of those who had
suffered so great a loss. Which then is the more fitting, that the
partial burning of some houses at Callinicum[^195], or the burning of
the city of Rome should be punished, if indeed either of them ought to
have been so. At Constantinople, a while ago, the Bishop’s[^196] house
was burnt, and your Majesty’s son interceded with you, that you would
not avenge the wrong done to him, the youthful Emperor, nor the burning
of the Bishop’s palace. Your Majesty should consider, that, if you
should in like manner command this act to be punished, he may again
intercede to prevent it. The former boon however was happily obtained
from the father by the son, for it was only fitting that he should
first remit the injury to himself. A good distribution of favour and
well allotted it is, that the son should be petitioned for his own loss,
and the father for the offence against his son. In this case there is
nothing which you need keep back on your son’s account, beware also
lest you derogate ought from God.

```{margin}
**Jer. vii. 14–17.**
```

14\. There is then no adequate reason for any such commotion, that the
people should be so severely punished for the burning of any building;
much less seeing that it is a synagogue that has been burnt, a place
of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of madness, which God
Himself hath condemned. For thus we read what the Lord our God spake by
the mouth of Jeremiah, _Therefore will I do unto this house, which is
called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to
you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. And I will cast you
out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole
seed of Ephraim. Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift
up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to Me, for I will
not hear thee. Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah?_
God forbids him to intercede for those whom you think worthy of being
avenged.

15\. Were I pleading according to the law of nations, I should assuredly
recount how many Churches the Jews burnt in the time of Julian’s reign:
two at Damascus, one of which is but just repaired, and that at the
expense, not of the synagogue, but of the Church, while the other is
still a mass of shapeless ruins. Churches were likewise burnt at Gaza,
Ascalon, Berytus, and nearly every town in that region, and yet no man
asked for vengeance. At Alexandria too the most beautiful Church of
all was burnt down by the Gentiles and Jews. The Church has not been
avenged, shall then the synagogue be?

16\. And shall the burning of the temple of the Valentinians likewise be
punished? For what but a temple is the place where Gentiles assemble?
The Gentiles indeed reckon twelve gods, the Valentinians worship thirty
two Æons[^197], whom they call gods. Concerning these I am informed that
they have called for punishment upon some monks. For the Valentinians
having endeavoured to stop them as they were going in procession
according to ancient custom, chanting psalms, to celebrate the festival
of the Maccabees, the monks exasperated by this affront, set fire to
one of their rudely constructed temples in some country village.

17\. How many have to offer themselves to this choice, remembering
that in Julian’s time he who threw down the altar and disturbed the
sacrifice was condemned by the judge, and suffered martyrdom. And
accordingly the judge who tried him was never considered other than
a persecutor, no man would associate with him, no man deemed him
worthy of a kiss of greeting. Were he not now dead, I should fear your
Majesty’s taking vengeance upon him. Nevertheless he escaped not the
Divine vengeance, but saw his son die before him.

18\. But it is reported that the judge was ordered to take cognizance
of the matter, and was informed that he ought not to have reported upon
it, but to have punished it, that the offerings which had been taken
away were to be demanded back. Other particulars I will omit; but when
the Jews burnt our Churches, nothing was restored, nothing demanded,
nothing sought for. But what could the synagogue possess in that
distant place, when everything in it was but of little value, nothing
precious or abundant. In short of what could a fire deprive the
treacherous Jews? These are devices of the Jews who wish to accuse us
falsely, that through their representations an extraordinary military
tribunal may be appointed, and an officer sent, who perhaps will say
what one said here before your accession, ‘How shall Christ help us,
when we fight for the Jews against Christ? when we are sent to take
vengeance on their behalf? They have lost their own armies, and they
wish to destroy ours.’

19\. Nay, what are the calumnies into which they will not rush, who by
false witnesses have slandered Christ Himself? who are false even in
matters relating to God? Whom will they not charge with the guilt of
this sedition? whom will they not thirst after, even though they know
them not? They desire to see rank after rank of Christians in chains,
to see the necks of the faithful placed under the yoke, the servants of
God hidden in darkness, smitten with the axe, delivered to the fire, or
sent to the mines, that their pains may be slow and lingering.

20\. Will your Majesty give this triumph to the Jews over the Church
of God? this victory over the people of Christ, this joy to the
unbelievers, this felicity to the Synagogue, this grief to the Church?
They will place this solemnity among their feast-days; numbering it
among those wherein they triumphed over the Ammonites, or Canaanites,
or over Pharaoh king of Egypt, or which delivered them from the hands
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. This festival they will add in
memory of the triumph they have gained over Christ’s people.

21\. Although they refuse to be bound by Roman laws, deeming them even
criminal, they now pretend to claim vengeance according to those laws.
Where were those laws, when they burnt the roofs of the consecrated
Basilicas? If Julian avenged not the Church because he was an Apostate,
will your Majesty, being a Christian, avenge the injury done to the
Synagogue?

```{margin}
**2 Sam. vii. 8.**
```

22\. And what will Christ hereafter say to you? Do you not remember
what he said to holy David by the prophet Nathan? ‘I have chosen thee
the youngest of thy brethren, and from private life have made thee
Emperor. I have placed thy offspring upon the Imperial throne. I have
put barbarous nations under thy feet, I have given thee peace, I have
delivered thine enemy captive into thy hands. Thou hadst no corn to
support thy army, I opened to thee the enemies’ gates, the enemies’
granaries, by their own hand; they gave thee the very stores which they
had provided for themselves. I confounded the counsels of thy enemy,
so that he laid bare his own plans. The very usurper of thy empire
I so bound, and so fettered his mind, that although he had the means
of flying from you he shut himself in with all his followers, as if
fearing lest any should escape you. His lieutenant[^198] and his forces
on the other element, whom I had before dispersed to prevent their
combining to make war on thee, I now called together again to render
thy victory complete. Thy army, an assemblage of many fierce nations,
I caused to keep faith and peace and concord, as if they had been one
nation. And when there was imminent danger lest the perfidious plots
of the barbarians should penetrate the Alps, I gave thee victory within
the very barrier of the Alps, that thy victory might be without loss.
Thus I made thee to triumph over thy enemy, and thou art giving my
enemies a triumph over my people.’

23\. Was it not the very reason why Maximus was abandoned, that before
he set out on his expedition, hearing that a synagogue had been burnt
at Rome, he sent an edict thither, acting as if he were the guardian of
public order. Wherefore the Christians said, No good awaits this man.
That king is become a Jew, and we have heard of him as a protector of
order, but Christ, who died for sinners, shortly after put him to the
proof[^199]. And if this was said of words only, what will be said of
actual punishment? So he was soon defeated by the Franks and by the
Saxons, in Sicily, at Siscia[^200], at Petavio, and in every quarter
of the globe. What has a devout man in common with an unbeliever? The
precedents of his impiety ought to be obliterated together with the
impious man himself. That which injured the vanquished, that at which
he stumbled, the victor ought to condemn, not to imitate.

```

24\. Now I have recounted these things to you not as though you were
ungrateful; rather I have spoken of them as being rightly bestowed,
that reminded thereby you may love much, as being one on whom much
has been bestowed. To Simon’s answer our Lord thus replied, _Thou hast
rightly judged_; and then, turning straightway to the woman who had
anointed His feet with ointment, and was the type of the Church, He
said to Simon, _Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many,
are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the
same loveth little_. This is that woman who entered the house of the
Pharisee, and cast out the Jew, but gained Christ. For the Church shut
out the Synagogue, and why is it now attempted, that, with the servant
of Christ, that is, from the breast of faith, and abode of Christ, the
Synagogue should shut out the Church.

25\. It is from affection and regard for your Majesty, that I have
introduced these things into my pleading. The beneficence which has led
you, at my request, to liberate many persons from exile, from prison,
from the extreme penalties of death, obliges me to incur the danger
of offending you for the sake of your own good, rather than lose in
one moment that privilege of every Bishop which I have for so long
possessed. For no man can feel greater confidence than he who zealously
loves, no man certainly ought to injure him who is careful for his
well-being. And yet it is not the loss of favour I deprecate, but the
danger to salvation.

26\. Yet how important it is that your Majesty should not think of
enquiry or punishment in a matter with regard to which no one up
to this time has ever held enquiry or inflicted punishment! It is a
grievous thing to hazard your faith for the sake of Jews. When Gideon
killed the consecrated calf, the Gentiles[^201] said, Let the gods
themselves avenge this affront towards them. Who is to avenge the
Synagogue? Christ Whom they slew, Whom they denied? Or will God the
Father avenge them, seeing that by rejecting the Son they have rejected
the Father also. Who is to avenge the heresy of the Valentinians? how
will your Piety be able to avenge them, seeing that you have commanded
them to be shut out, and forbidden them to meet together? And should
I bring forward to you the example of King Josiah as approved of God,
will you condemn in this case that for which he is praised?

27\. But if you do not place sufficient confidence in me, let your
Majesty command the presence of those bishops whom you do approve,
and let the question be discussed, what ought to be done so as not
to injure the Faith. If in financial matters you consult your Courts,
how much more fitting is it that in the cause of religion you should
consult the Bishops of the Lord?

28\. Let your Clemency consider what dangerous spies and liers in wait
the Church has against her, if they find ever so small an opening they
will plant a dart therein. I speak after the manner of men; but God is
feared more than men, and is rightly preferred to Emperors themselves.
If any man thinks obedience should be paid to a friend, a parent, or
a neighbour, am I wrong in deeming that God should be obeyed, and that
in preference to all others. Let your Majesty consult for your own
well-being, or suffer me to consult for mine.

29\. What shall I hereafter answer, if it shall appear that by an edict
issued from hence Christians have been slain by the sword, or beaten to
death with clubs or thongs loaded with lead? How shall I justify such
an act, how shall I excuse it to those Bishops who having discharged
the office of the priesthood for thirty years, nay for many more, have
now bitterly to bewail, being deprived of their sacred functions and
called to undertake municipal offices. If[^202] those who fight for you
are set free after a certain period of service, how much more ought you
to consider those who fight for God! How I repeat, shall I defend this
to the Bishops who complain in behalf of the clergy, and write word
that the Churches are overborne by violent oppression.

30\. This however I desired should be made known to your Majesty; about
this you will deign to deliberate and direct according to your will;
but as to that which distresses and rightly distresses myself, exclude
and reject it from your consideration. You do yourself whatsoever you
have commanded to be done; even if he[^203] do it not, I would rather
that you should be merciful than that he should refuse to do what he
has been commanded.

31\. Here are persons in dealing with whom you ought still to invite and
earn the Clemency of God towards the Roman empire; here are persons for
whom rather than for yourself you have to hope; let their grace, their
well-being, appeal to you in what I now say. I fear your entrusting
your cause to the judgement of others. As yet you are committed to
nothing. Herein I will pledge myself for you to our God, fear not your
oath. That change cannot be displeasing to God which is made for His
honour. You have no need to alter your former letter whether it be yet
dispatched or not, but command another to be written which shall be
replete with faith and piety. It is open to you to change, it is not
open to me to keep back the truth.

32\. You have forgiven the people of Antioch[^204] their offence against
you, you have recalled the daughters of your enemy[^205], you have
committed them to be nurtured by their relative, you have bestowed
money from your treasury on the mother of your enemy. This great piety,
this great faith towards God will be obscured by your present act.
Having thus spared your armed foes, and preserved your enemies, do not,
I beseech you, so eagerly seek for vengeance upon Christians.

33\. And now I entreat your Majesty not to disdain to listen to my fears
both for yourself and myself; for it is the saying of an holy man, _Woe
is me, wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people?_ is it
that I should incur the risk of offending God? Assuredly I have done
what is most respectful to you: I have sought that you should listen to
me in the palace, that you might not have to listen to me in the Church.

[^193]: distinxisti ei.

[^194]: ‘Oriens’ or ‘the East’ was the title of the great civil
    ‘diocese’ which included Syria, Palestine, Cilicia, Cyprus,
    Mesopotamia, and some adjacent districts, and corresponded
    to the Patriarchate of Antioch in the ecclesiastical
    division. It was originally under one chief called ‘Comes
    orientis,’ but it would appear from this passage, as
    is asserted by Gothofred, that the civil and military
    functions had been divided, and there were now two
    officers, ‘Comes orientis militarium partium,’ and
    ‘Comes orientis civilium partium.’ The subject is somewhat
    obscure.

[^195]: Callinicum was in Osrhoene, a name given to the
    north-western part of Mesopotamia.

[^196]: Socrates, B. v. ch. 13., mentions that Nectarius’ house
    was burnt by the Arian party in the same year in which
    this letter was written.

[^198]: Andragathius, who commanded a fleet in Maximus’ interest
    expecting Theodosius to come to Italy by sea.

[^199]: The Benedictine editors say ‘tota hæc pericope in uno
    Cod. Reg. desideratur: forte non male.’ It is difficult
    to elicit any sense from it.

[^200]: Siscia, now Sissek, was a large town in upper Pannonia,
    on the south bank of the Save. Petavio, now Pettau, was
    on the Drave. It seems likely that ‘in Sicilia’ should
    be omitted, as being only a false meaning for ‘Sciscia.’
    There is no mention of Sicily being in any way connected
    with the war. But see Tillemont, Theod. art. xlv.

[^201]: S. Ambrose is quoting from memory and slightly varies the
    facts from the narrative in book of Judges.

[^202]: See a learned note in Newman’s Fleury vol. 1 p. 162,
    on the exemption of the Clergy from municipal offices,
    compare also Letter xviii. 14, and the note there.

[^203]: i. e. the Count of the East.

[^204]: This refers to the famous sedition at Antioch, when the
    mob, enraged at the imposition of new taxes, overthrew
    the Emperor’s statues, and dragged them through the city.
    After a period of suspense, during which S. Chrysostom
    preached the Homilies on the Statues, Theodosius, who had
    at first been violently enraged, sent them a free pardon.
    This was in the previous year.

[^205]: i. e. of Maximus.
