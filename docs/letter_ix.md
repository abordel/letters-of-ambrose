```{centered} THE COUNCIL WHICH IS ASSEMBLED AT AQUILEIA TO OUR MOST BELOVED BRETHREN, THE BISHOPS OF THE VIENNESE AND THE FIRST AND SECOND NARBONESE PROVINCES[^40] IN GAUL
```

1\. WE return thanks to your holy unanimity that in the persons of
our Lords and brethren Constantius and Proculus you have given us the
presence of you all, and at the same time following the directions of
former times, have added not a little weight to our judgement, with
which the profession of your holinesses also is in agreement, Lords
and brethren most beloved. Therefore, as we received with gladness the
above mentioned holy men of your order and ours, so do we also dismiss
them with an abundant offering of thanks.

2\. But how necessary the meeting was will be plain from the mere facts,
since the adversaries and enemies of God, the defenders of the Arian
sect and heresy, Palladius and Secundianus, the only two who dared
to come to the meeting of the Council, received in person their due
sentence, being convicted of impiety. Farewell. May our Almighty God
keep you safe and prosperous, Lords and brethren most beloved. Amen.

[^40]: It is probable that similar letters were addressed to
    the Bishops of the other Provinces of Gaul, who had
    sent Justus as their deputy, and to Africa and Illyricum,
    though no record of them remains. Possibly they were
    identical, except the address. Gaul had at this time
    been so subdivided, that the Vicariate or civil Diocese
    consisted of no less than seventeen provinces. See
    Marquardtâ€™s Table, as quoted above.
