> S. AMBROSE dwells on the mutual love of himself and Antonius.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO ANTONIUS
```

1\. YOU never are silent in regard of me, nor ought I ever to complain
of being neglected by your silence, knowing that I am not absent from
your thoughts. For since you bestow that which is the most precious,
how can you withhold that which many others receive, not so much from
any habitual affection as from an interchange of civility.

2\. And even from my own feelings I can judge in turn of yours, and
these lead me to believe that I am never absent from you, nor you
from me, so closely are our souls united. Nor do I feel as if we ever
required each othersâ€™ letters, for I daily converse with you as if
present in body, turning towards you my eyes, my affections, and all
my regards.

3\. In such things as these I delight to cope with you; for, to speak
openly with one who is inseparable from my heart, your letters make
me ashamed. I beg therefore that you will cease to be always returning
me thanks, for my services to you have their highest reward, if I may
believe I have not been wanting in my duty towards you.

Farewell; love me, for I also love you.
