# Letter XIV
**A.D. 382**

> THIS letter is a reply to one addressed to the Bishops of
> Italy by Theodosius, in answer to the last. He seems in it to
> have “undeceived them by informing them what Maximus was, and
> how different his ordination was from that of Nectarius. He
> represented to them that these affairs, and that of Flavian,
> ought to be judged in the East, where all the parties were
> present, and that there was no reason to oblige those of the
> East to come unto the West.” (Fleury xviii, 17, vol. 1. p. 41,
> Newman’s Transl.) The Bishops in this reply thank the Emperor
> for his efforts to appease the differences between the East and
> West, and profess the disinterestedness of their desire for a
> general Council, and add, as an additional reason for it, the
> spread of opinions attributed to Apollinaris, which require to
> be examined into in the presence of the parties concerned.

```{centered} TO THE MOST BLESSED EMPEROR AND MOST GRACIOUS PRINCE THEODOSIUS, AMBROSE AND THE OTHER BISHOPS OF ITALY
```

1\. THE knowledge of your faith, which is diffused over the whole world,
has soothed the innermost feelings of our minds; and therefore, that
your reign might have the additional glory of having restored unity to
the Churches both of the West and East, we have thought it right, most
serene and faithful Emperor, at once to beseech and inform your Grace
on Ecclesiastical subjects by our letter. For we have been grieved
that the fellowship of holy Communion between the East and West was
interrupted.

2\. We say not a word by whose error or by whose fault this was, that
we may not be supposed to be spreading fables and idle talk. Nor can
we regret having made an attempt, the neglect of which might have
turned to our blame. For it was often made matter of blame to us that
we appeared to disregard the society of the Eastern brethren, and to
reject their kindness.

3\. We thought moreover that we ought to take this trouble on ourselves,
not for Italy, which now for this long time has been quiet and free
from anxiety on the part of the Arians, and which is troubled with no
disturbance of the heretics; not for ourselves, for we seek not our own
things, but the things of all; not for Gaul and Africa which enjoy the
individual fellowship of all their Bishops, but that the circumstances
which have disturbed our communion on the side of the East might be
enquired into in the Synod, and all scruple be removed from among us.

4\. For not only with regard to the persons about whom your Grace
condescended to write, but with regard to others who are attempting to
bring into the Church some dogma or other, said to be Apollinaris’[^58],
there were several things that affected us, to which the knife should
have been applied in the presence of the parties, that a person
convicted of maintaining a new dogma and proved to be in error should
not shelter himself under the general name of the Faith, but at once
lay down both the office and name of Bishop, which he was not entitled
to by authority of doctrine, and that no threads or artifices of
delusion should remain for persons hereafter wishing to deceive. For
the person who is convicted, not in the presence of the parties, as
your Grace has truly decided in your august and princely answer, will
always lay hold of a handle for reviving the enquiry.

5\. This was why we asked for a Council of Bishops, that no one
should be permitted to state what was false against a person in his
absence, and that the truth might be cleared up by discussion in the
Council. We ought not then to incur any suspicion either of over-zeal
or over-leniency, seeing that we made all our observations in the
presence of the parties.

6\. In truth we drew up what was quoted, not to decide but to
give information, and while we asked for a judgement, we offer no
prejudgement. Nor ought it to have been regarded as any reproach to
them, when Bishops were invited to the Council, who in many cases were
more present by their very absence, since it contributed to the common
good. For neither did we conceive it to be a reproach to us when a
Presbyter of the Church of Constantinople, by name Paulus, demanded
that there should be a Synod both of Eastern and Western Bishops in
the province of Achaia.

7\. Your Grace observes that this demand, which was made by the Greeks
also, was not unreasonable. But, because there are disturbances in
Illyricum[^59], a neighbourhood near the sea and safer was sought.
Nor have we indeed made any innovation in the way of precedent, but
preserving the decisions of Athanasius of holy memory, who was as
it were a pillar of the Faith, and of our holy fathers of old time
in their Councils, we do not tear up the boundaries that our Fathers
placed, or violate the rights of hereditary Communion, but reserving
the honour due to your authority, we shew ourselves studious of peace
and quietness[^60].

[^58]: The sense is here to be elicited probably by repeating
    the word ‘quod,’ so that the sentence should run, ‘dogma
    nescio quod, quod Apollinaris asseritur.’

[^59]: There seems to be something corrupt in the text. Perhaps
    we should read ‘moventur,’ ‘the dangerous parts of
    Illyricum are in commotion;’ or ‘suspecta’ has taken the
    place of some word, such as ‘superiora,’ which would stand
    in antithesis to ‘maritima.’

[^60]: It may complete the subject of this series of letters
    to remind the reader that about the same time that the
    Council of the Italian Bishops was held, Theodosius
    convened a second Council at Constantinople to deal
    with the questions raised by the Westerns, where most of
    the Bishops who had formed the previous General Council
    re-assembled. They replied to the invitation to another
    General Council at Rome by a Synodical letter, which is
    given at full length by Theodoret (Eccles. Hist. v. 9.).
    In it they excuse themselves from attending, on the ground
    of their presence being required in their own Dioceses,
    especially after the long exile of many of them, and the
    prevalence of Arian usurpation, wishing that they ‘had
    the wings of a dove,’ to fly to their Western brethren.
    They then give a summary of the doctrinal decisions of
    the two Councils, and announce that they have sent three
    Bishops as deputies to explain all things more fully to
    them, and, with reference to the disputed successions at
    Constantinople and Antioch, give their assurance to their
    brethren that both Nectarius and Flavian were canonically
    elected, and the elections ratified both by the clergy
    and the faithful of each diocese, and by the Council,
    reminding them of the ancient Canon re-affirmed at Nicæa
    that each province should settle all such questions for
    themselves.
