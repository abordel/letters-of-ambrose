# Letter II
**A.D. 379**

> WE gather from the letter itself that Constantius, to whom it
> is addressed was a newly appointed Bishop, but of what see does
> not appear. In § 27 S. Ambrose commends to his care the see of
> Forum Cornelii, which was vacant at the time, as being in his
> neighbourhood. The grounds on which the Benedictine Editors
> fix the date seem rather vague. Its interest however is not
> historical: it is simply hortatory, urging on Constantius
> the fulfilment of the duties of his new office, and setting
> before him the chief subjects to which his preaching should
> be addressed. From S. Ambrose calling him ‘my son’ (§ 27) it
> would seem that he was either one of his own clergy, or had been
> in some way under his guidance. It is interesting as shewing
> how a great Bishop of that age dwelt upon the relations of the
> Episcopate, not merely to the Clergy under him as their superior,
> but to the laity of his diocese as their chief teacher.

**Ps.xxiv. 2.**
```
1\. YOU have undertaken the office of a Bishop, and now, seated in the
stern of the Church, you are steering it in the teeth of the waves.
Hold fast the rudder of faith, that you may not be shaken by the heavy
storms of this world. The sea indeed is vast and deep, but fear not,
_for He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods_.
Rightly then the Church of the Lord, amid all the seas of the world,
stands immoveable, built as it were, upon the Apostolic rock; and her
foundation remains unshaken by all the force of the raging surge. The
waves lash but do not shake it; and although this world’s elements
often break against it with a mighty sound, still it offers a secure
harbour of safety to receive the distressed.

```

2\. Yet although it is tossed on the sea, it rides upon the floods; and
perhaps chiefly on those floods of which it is said, _The floods have
lift up their voice_. For there are _rivers_, which _shall flow out of
his belly_, who has received to drink from Christ, and partaken of the
Spirit of God. These rivers then, when they overflow with spiritual
grace, lift up their voice. There is a river too, which runs down upon
His saints like a torrent. And there are _the rivers of the flood_,
which _make glad_ the peaceful and tranquil soul. He that receives,
as did John the Evangelist, as did Peter and Paul, the fulness of this
stream, lifts up his voice; and like as the Apostles loudly heralded
forth to the farthest limits of the globe the Evangelic message, so
he also begins to preach the Lord Jesus. Receive to drink therefore
of Christ, that your sound may also go forth.

```{margin}
**Prov. xvi. 24.**
```

3\. The Divine Scripture is a sea, containing in it deep meanings,
and an abyss of prophetic mysteries; and into this sea enter many
rivers. There are sweet and transparent streams, cool[^3] fountains too
there are, _springing up into life eternal_, and _pleasant words as an
honey-comb_. Agreeable sentences too there are, refreshing the minds
of the hearers, if I may say so, with spiritual drink, and soothing
them with the sweetness of their moral precepts. Various then are the
streams of the sacred Scriptures. There is in them a first draught for
you, a second, and a last.

4\. Gather the water of Christ, that which _praises the Lord_. Gather
from many sources that water which the prophetic _clouds pour forth_.
He that gathers water from the hills and draws it to himself from the
fountains, he also drops down dew like the clouds. Fill then the bosom
of your mind, that your ground may be moistened and watered by domestic
springs. He who needs and apprehends much is filled, he who hath been
filled waters others, and therefore Scripture saith, _If the clouds be
full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth_.

```{margin}
**Ib. xii. 11.**

**Acts ix. 5.**
```

5\. Let your discourses then be flowing, let them be clear and lucid;
pour the sweetness of your moral arguments into the ears of the people,
and sooth them with the charm of your words, that so they may willingly
follow your guidance. But if there be any contumacy or transgression
in the people or individuals, let your sermons be of such a character
as shall move your audience, and prick the evil conscience, for _the
words of the wise are as goads_. The Lord Jesus too pricked Saul, when
he was a persecutor. And think how salutary the goad was which from a
persecutor made him an Apostle, by simply saying, _It is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks_.

6\. There are discourses too like milk, such as Paul fed the Corinthians
with; for they who cannot digest stronger food, must have their infant
minds nourished with the juice of milk.

```{margin}
**Prov. xv. 7.**
```

7\. Let your addresses be full of understanding. As Solomon says,
_The[^4] lips of the wise are the weapons of the understanding_, and
in another place, _Let your lips be bound up with sense_, that is, let
your discourses be clear and bright, let them flash with intelligence
like lightning: let not your address or arguments stand in need of
enforcement from without, but let your discourse defend itself, so to
speak, with its own weapons, and let no vain or unmeaning word issue
out of your mouth. For there is a bandage to bind up the wounds of
the soul, and if any one cast it aside, he shews that his recovery
is desperate. Wherefore to those who are afflicted with a grievous
ulcer administer the oil of your discourse to soften the hardness
of their heart, apply an emollient, bind on the ligature of salutary
precepts; beware lest by any means you suffer men who are unstable and
vacillating in faith or in the observance of discipline, to perish with
minds unbraced and vigour relaxed.

8\. Wherefore admonish and entreat the people of God that they abound in
good works, that they renounce iniquity, that they kindle not the fires
of lust, (I say not on the Sabbath only, but never,) lest they set on
fire their own bodies; that there be no fornication or uncleanness in
the servants of God, for we serve the immaculate Son of God. Let every
man know himself, and possess his own vessel, that, having, so to say,
broken up the fallow ground of his body, he may expect fruit in due
season, and it may not _bring forth thorns and thistles_, but he too
may say, _Our land hath given her increase_; and on this once wild
thicket of the passions a graft of virtue may flourish.

9\. Teach moreover and train the people to do what is good and that
no one fail to perform works which shall be approved, whether he be
seen of many, or be without witness, for the conscience is a witness
abundantly sufficient unto itself.

```{margin}
**Gen. iv. 10.**
```

10\. And let them avoid shameful deeds, even though they believe they
cannot be detected. For though a man be shut up within walls, and
covered with darkness, without witness and without accomplice, still
he has a Judge of his acts, Whom nothing ever deceives, and to Whom all
things cry aloud. To Him the voice of _blood cried from the ground_.
Every man has in himself and his own conscience a strict judge, an
avenger of his wickedness and of his crimes. Cain wandered about in
fear and trembling, suffering the punishment of his unnatural deed; so
that death was to him a refuge, relieving the wandering outcast from
that terror of death which he felt at every moment. Let no man then
either alone or in company commit any shameful or wicked act. Though
he be alone, let him be abashed before himself more than before others,
for to himself is his greatest reverence due.

11\. Nor let him covet many things, for even few things are to him as
many; for poverty and wealth are words implying want and sufficiency.
He is not rich who needs any thing, nor he poor who needs not. And
let no man despise a widow, circumvent a ward, defraud his neighbour.
_Woe unto him, whose substance has been collected by guile_, and _who
buildeth a town_, that is his own soul, _with blood_. For this it
is, which _is built as a city_; and this city avarice builds not but
destroys, lust builds not but sets on fire and consumes. Wouldest thou
build this city well? _Better is little with the fear of the Lord, than
great treasure without that fear._ A man’s riches ought to avail to the
ransom of his soul, not to its destruction. And a treasure is a ransom,
if a man use it well; on the other hand it is a snare, if a man know
not how to use it. What is a man’s money to him but a provision for
his journey? Much is a burthen, a little is useful. We are wayfarers
in this life; many walk, but it is needful that we walk aright, for
then is the Lord Jesus with us, as we read, _When thou passest through
the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not
overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be
burned_. But if a man take fire in his bosom, the fire of lust, the
fire of immoderate desire he _walketh not through_, but burns this
clothing of his soul. _A good name is rather to be chosen than great
riches, and loving favour than silver and gold!_ Faith is sufficient
for itself, and in its own possession is rich enough. And to the
wise man nothing is foreign, but what is contrary to virtue; wherever
he goes, he finds all things to be his own. All the world is his
possession, for he uses it all if it were his own.

12\. Why then is our brother circumvented, why is our hired servant
defrauded? Little it is said, is gained by the wages of an harlot, that
is to say, of frailty so delusive. This harlot is not an individual,
but something general; not one woman, but every idle lust. All perfidy,
all deceit is this harlot; not she alone who offers her body to
defilement; but every soul that barters away its hope, and seeks a
dishonourable profit, and an unworthy reward. And we are hired servants,
in that we labour for hire, and look for the reward of this our work
from our Lord and God. If any one would know how we are hired servants,
let him listen to the words, _How many hired servants of my father
have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger_, and again,
_Make me as one of thy hired servants_. All are hired servants, all
are labourers; and let him, who looks for the reward of his labour,
remember that if he defraud another of the wages due to him, he also
will be defrauded of his own. Such conduct offends Him Who has lent
to us, and He will repay it hereafter in more abundant measure. He
therefore who could not lose what is eternal, let him not deprive
others of what is temporal.

13\. And let no one speak deceitfully with his neighbour. _There is a
snare in our mouths_, and not seldom is it that _a man is entangled_
rather than cleared _by his words_. _The mouth of the evil-minded is a
deep pit_: great is the fall of innocence, but greater that of iniquity.
The simple, by giving too easy credit, quickly falls, but when fallen
he rises again; but the evil-speaker is so cast down by his own acts
that he never can recover himself and escape. Therefore let every man
weigh his words, not with deceit and guile, for _a false balance is
abomination to the Lord_. I do not mean that balance which weighs
the wares of others, (though even in lesser matters deceit often
costs dear,) but that balance of words is hateful to the Lord, which
wears the mask of the weight of sober gravity, and yet practises
the artifices of cunning. Great is God’s anger, if a man deceive his
neighbour by flattering promises, and by treacherous subtlety oppress
his debtor, a craft which will not benefit himself. For what is a
man profited, if he shall gain the riches of the whole world, and yet
defraud his own soul of the wages of eternal life?

```{margin}
**1 Tim. v. 24.**
```

14\. There is another balance which pious minds ought to consider,
wherein the actions of individuals are weighed, and wherein for the
most part sin inclines the scale towards judgement, or outweighs good
deeds with crimes. Woe unto me, if my offences _go before_, and with
a fatal weight incline to the judgement of death! More terrible will
it be if they _follow after_, though they all be manifest to God, even
before judgement; neither can things good be secret, nor things full
of scandal be concealed.

```{margin}
**Ib. vi. 10.**
```

15\. How blessed is he who can extirpate avarice, the root of all evil!
he truly need not fear this balance. For avarice is wont to deaden
man’s senses, and pervert his judgement, so that he counts godliness
a source of gain, and money the reward of prudence. But great is the
reward of piety, and the gain of sobriety to have enough for use. For
what do superfluous riches profit in this world, when you find in them
neither a succour in birth nor a defence against death? For without a
covering are we born into the world, without provision we depart hence,
and in the grave we have no inheritance.

```{margin}
**Zech. v. 7.**
```

16\. The deserts of each one of us are suspended in the balance, which a
little weight either of good works or of degenerate conduct sways this
way or that; if the evil preponderate, woe is me! if the good, pardon
is at hand. For no man is free from sin; but where good preponderates,
the evil flies up, is overshadowed, and covered. Wherefore in the Day
of judgement our works will either succour us, or will sink us into
the deep, weighed down as with a millstone. For iniquity is heavy,
supported as by a _talent of lead_; avarice is intolerable, and all
pride is foul dishonesty. Wherefore exhort the people of God to trust
rather in the Lord, to abound in the riches of simplicity, wherein they
may walk without snare and without hindrance.

17\. For the sincerity of a pure speech is good, and rich in the sight
of God, although it walk among snares; yet, because it is innocent of
laying wait or enthralling others, it escapes itself.

18\. A great thing too it is if you can persuade them to know how to be
abased, to know the true garb and nature of humility. Many possess the
shew of humility, but not its power; many possess it abroad, but oppose
it at home; colourably they pretend it, but in truth they renounce
it, in regard of grace they deny it. For _there is one that humbleth
himself wickedly and his inward parts are full of deceit. And there is
one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great lowliness._ There
is no true humility then but such as is without colour and pretence.
Such humility is that which hath a pious sincerity of mind. Great is
its virtue. Finally _by one man’s disobedience death entered_, and by
the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ came the redemption of all.

```{margin}
**Ps. cv. 18.**
```

19\. Holy Joseph knew how to be abased, who, when he was sold into
bondage by his brethren, and purchased by merchants, _whose feet_ as
the Scripture saith, ‘_they hurt in the stocks_,’ learned the virtue
of humility and laid aside all weakness. For when he was bought by
the royal servant, officer of the household, the memory of his noble
descent as one of the seed of Abraham did not cause him to disdain
servile offices or scorn his mean condition. On the contrary he was
diligent and faithful in his master’s service, knowing in his prudence
that it matters not in what station a man renders himself approved, but
that the object of good men is to merit approbation in whatever station
they are placed; and the point of importance is that their character
should dignify their station rather than their station their character.
In proportion as the station is low the merit becomes illustrious. And
such attention did Joseph exhibit that his lord entrusted to him his
whole house, and committed to him all that he had.

20\. And so his wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, captivated by the beauty
of his form. Now we are not in fault, if either our age or our beauty
becomes an object of desire to wanton eyes; let it be artless, and no
blame attaches to beauty; if enticement be away, seemliness and grace
of form is innocent. But this woman, fired with love, addresses the
youth, and at the instigation of lust, overpowered by the force of
passion confesses her crime. But he rejects the crime, saying that to
defile another man’s bed was consonant neither with the customs nor
the laws of the Hebrews, whose care it was to protect modesty, and
to provide chaste spouses for chaste virgins, avoiding all unlawful
intercourse, And that it were an impious deed for him, intoxicated by
impure passion, and regardless of his master’s kindness, to inflict a
deadly injury on one to whom he owed obedience.

21\. Nor did he disdain to call the despised Egyptian his master, and
to confess himself his servant. And when the woman courted him, urging
him by the fear of betrayal, or shedding passionate tears to force his
compliance, neither was he moved by compassion to consent to iniquity,
nor constrained by fear, but he resisted her entreaties and yielded not
to her threats, preferring a perilous virtue to rewards, and chastity
to a disgraceful recompense. Again she assailed him with greater
temptations, yet she found him inflexible, yea for the second time
immoveable; yet her furious and shameless passion gave her strength,
and she caught the youth by his robe and drew him to her couch,
offering to embrace him, nay, she would have done so, had not Joseph
put off his robe; he put it off, that he might not put off the robe of
humility, the covering of modesty.

```{margin}
**Eph. v. 14.**
```

22\. He then knew how to be abased, for he was degraded even to the
dungeon; and thus unjustly treated, he chose rather to bear a false
accusation than to bring the true one. He knew how to be abased, I say,
for he was abased for virtue’s sake. He was abased as a type of Him
Who was to abase Himself even to death, the death of the cross, Who was
to come to raise our life from sleep, and to teach that our human life
is but a dream: its vicissitudes reel past us as it were, with nothing
in them firm or stable, but like men in a trance seeing we see not,
hearing we hear not, eating we are not filled, congratulating we joy
not, running we attain not. Vain are men’s hopes in this world, idly
pursuing the things that are not as though they were; and so, as in a
dream, the empty forms of things come and go, appear and vanish; they
hover around us, and we seem to grasp yet grasp them not. But when a
man has heard Him that saith _Awake, thou that sleepest_, and rises up
from the sleep of this world, then he perceives that all these things
are false; he is now awake, and the dream is fled, and with it is fled
ambition, and the care of wealth, and beauty of form, and the pursuit
of honours. For these things are dreams which affect not those whose
hearts wake, but affect only them that slumber.

23\. And holy Joseph certifies this my assertion, that the things of
this world are not perpetual or lasting, for he, noble by birth and
with a rich inheritance, suddenly becomes a despised servant, and (what
enhances the bitterness of servitude) a slave bought for a price by an
unworthy master. For to serve the free is esteemed less disgraceful,
but to be the servant of servants is a double slavery. Thus from
being nobly born he became a slave, from having a wealthy father he
became poor, from love he fell into hate, from favour into punishment.
Again, he is raised from the prison to the court, from the bar to the
judgement-seat. But he is neither depressed by adversity nor elated by
prosperity.

```{margin}
**Ps. cxix. 71.**
```

24\. The frequently changing condition of holy David also testifies how
fleeting are the vicissitudes of life. He, overlooked by his father,
but precious in the sight of God, exalted by his success, thrust down
by envy, summoned to the service of the king and chosen to be his
son-in-law, then again disguised in face and appearance, banished from
the kingdom, flying from death at his own son’s hands, weeping for
his own offences, atoning for those of others, nobler in winning back
the affection of the heir to his throne, than if he had disgraced him.
Having thus tried every condition he says well, _It is good for me that
I have been humbled_.

```{margin}
**Phil. ii. 6, 7.**

**1 Cor. xv. 28.**

**Ib. xi. 1.**
```

25\. This sentence however might well also be referred to Him Who
_being in the form of God_, and able to bow the heavens, yet came down,
and _taking upon Him the form of a servant_, bore our infirmities.
He, foreseeing that His saints would not think it a prize to claim
the honour that belonged to them, but would give place to their equals
and prefer others to themselves, said, _It is good for me that I have
been humbled_; it is good for me that I have subjected myself, that all
things _may be subject unto me, and God may be all in all_. Instil this
humility into the minds of all, and shew yourself an example to all
saying, _Be ye followers of me, even as I am also of Christ_.

26\. Let them learn to seek the wealth of good wishes, and to be rich
in holiness; the beauty of wealth consists not in the possession of
money-bags, but in the maintenance of the poor. It is in the sick and
needy that riches shine most. Wherefore let the wealthy learn to seek
not their own things, but the things of Jesus Christ, that Christ also
may seek them, and recompense to them what is their own. He spent for
them His blood, He pours forth on them His Spirit, He offers to them
His kingdom. What more shall He give, Who gave Himself, or what shall
not the Father give, Who delivered up His Only Son to die for our
sakes? Admonish them therefore to serve the Lord soberly and with grace,
to lift their eyes with all diligence to heaven, to count nothing gain
but what appertains to eternal life; for all this worldly gain is the
loss of souls. He who desired _to win Christ, suffered the loss of all
things_, which saying, marvellous as it is, falls short of what he had
received, for he speaks of external things only, whereas Christ hath
said, _If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself_; let him
lose himself so that Christ be gained. Fleeting are all things here,
they bring loss and not gain; that only is gain, where enjoyment is
perpetual, where eternal rest is our reward.

27\. I commend to your care, my son, the Church which is at Forum
Cornelii[^5]; Being nigh thereunto, visit it frequently until a Bishop
for it be ordained; I myself, engaged with the approaching season of
Lent, cannot go to such a distance.

28\. There you will find certain Illyrians imbued with the false
doctrines of Arius; take heed of their tares, let them not come near
the faithful, nor scatter their spurious seed. Let them remember what
their perfidy has brought upon them[^6], let them be quiet and follow
the true faith. Difficult indeed it is for minds imbued with the poison
of unbelief to rid themselves of this impiety, for it cleaves to them;
and if the fatal venom has grown inveterate in them, you must not
readily give them credence. For the very sinews and strength of wisdom
lie in not giving credence too readily, especially in the matter of
faith, which in men is seldom perfect.

29\. Yet if any one, whose frailty is suspected and inclination dubious,
desire nevertheless to clear himself of suspicion; suffer him to
believe that he has made satisfaction, show him some indulgence, for
if a man be cut off from reconciliation his mind is estranged. Thus
skilful physicians, when they observe what they deem to be well-known
diseases, do not apply a remedy, but wait their time, attending upon
the sick man, and administering to him such soothing appliance as
they can, to the intent that the disease may neither be aggravated by
neglect or despair, nor may reject the medicine applied too early, for
if an inexperienced physician touch it prematurely, it will never come
to a head, just as even an apple, if shaken from the tree while yet
unripe, soon withers.

```{margin}
**Deut. xix. 14.**
```

30\. Enjoin them too (as I have borrowed a figure from agriculture)
to preserve inviolate the laws of common boundary, and to guard those
paternal landmarks which the law protects. The affection of a neighbour
often exceeds the love of a brother, for the one is often afar off,
the other nigh at hand; the witness of your whole life, and judge of
your conduct. Allow his cattle to stray at large over the neighbouring
bounds, and to rest securely on the green herbage.

31\. Let the master too temper with moderation his lawful rule over his
servants, seeing that in soul they are brethren. For he is called the
father of the family, that he may govern them as sons; for he himself
also is God’s servant, and calls the Lord of heaven, the Source of all
power, his Father.

Farewell; continue to love me, as I do you.
