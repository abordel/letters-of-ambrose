# Letter on the Case of Bonosus
**A.D. 392 or 393**

> THIS letter is certainly not written by S. Ambrose, though

> (45.) and makes it probable that it was written by Siricius.
>
> The case of Bonosus had been brought before the Synod of Capua,
> and they had decided that it should be referred to the Bishops
> of Macedonia, under the presidency of Anysius Bishop of
> Thessalonica, as being his nearest neighbours. These Bishops
> seem to have written a letter to consult Siricius, the Bishop of
> Rome, and this is believed to be his reply, in which he declines
> to interfere with their decision, only adding a few remarks
> upon one point. Bonosus was Bishop of Sardica[^239] in Illyria,

```{centered} A LETTER CONCERNING THE DECIDING OF THE CASE OF BONOSUS, ACCORDING TO THE DECREE OF THE SYNOD OF CAPUA
```

1\. YOU have written to us a Letter concerning Bishop Bonosus in which,
either from love of truth or from modesty, you enquire our opinion.
But since it has been the judgment of the Council of Capua that those
who are neighbours to Bonosus and his accusers should be assigned his
judges, and specially the Macedonian Bishops, who, with the Bishop of
Thessalonica, should judge of his acts and writings, we have to remark
that the function of judging cannot appertain to ourselves. Otherwise,
were the question of the Synod at this day still open, we might well
have decided concerning these things which are included in what you
have written at length. Having taken upon yourselves this judgment, it
is now your part to form your decision on the whole question, to give
no power of retreat or escape either to the accusers or the accused;
for, being chosen by the Synod to conduct the examination, you have
taken upon you its functions.

2\. Again, when Bishop Bonosus, after your judgment, sent to our brother
Ambrose to enquire his opinion whether he should break into and enter
upon the church which was closed to him, he received for reply that he
must do nothing rashly, that everything must be carried on modestly,
patiently and in order, that nothing contrary to your decision must
be attempted, that you, to whom the Synod had committed such authority,
would appoint what appeared to you agreeable to justice. The first
point therefore is that judgment should be given by those to whom the
power of judging has been given; for you, as we have said, judge in
place of the entire Synod; as to ourselves it does not befit us to
judge as though by the authority of the Synod.

3\. Assuredly we cannot deny that he is justly blamed concerning the
sons of Mary, and that your Holiness deservedly repudiated the opinion
that from the same Virgin womb, of which according to the flesh Christ
was born, other offspring was produced. For the Lord Jesus would not
have chosen to be born of a Virgin, if He had conceived she would be so
wanting in continence as to suffer that birthplace of the Lord’s Body,
that palace of the eternal King, to be polluted by human intercourse.
To propound such an opinion as this, what is it but to fortify the
unbelief of the Jews who say that it was impossible He could be born of
a Virgin, and who, thus confirmed by the authority of Christian Bishops,
will strive with greater earnestness to overthrow the true faith?

**S. John xix. 26, 27.**

**S. Matt. i. 18.**
```

4\. What else can be the meaning of that text wherein the Lord says to
His Mother of John the Evangelist, _Woman, behold thy son_, and again
to John of Mary, _Behold thy mother_? With what purpose was it that
while the Lord was hanging upon the cross and atoning for the sins
of the world, He declared also the integrity of His Mother? Wherefore
was it said but that unbelief might close its lips and be silent, nor
dare to offer any insult to the Mother of the Lord? He therefore, in
pronouncing upon and asserting His Mother’s chastity, likewise bears
witness that she was only espoused to her husband Joseph; and that she
was ignorant of that carnal commerce which is the accustomed right of
the marriage bed; for, had it been that she was to conceive children
of Joseph, He would not have chosen to separate her from the company
of her husband.

**S. John xix. 27.**
```

5\. But if this is not enough, the Evangelist has added his testimony,
saying that the _disciple took her unto his own home_. Did he then
cause a divorce? Did he carry her off from her husband? How can he who
reads this in the Gospel stagger and waver to and fro as one who has
been shipwrecked?

```{margin}
**Ib. 30.**
```

6\. This then is the testimony of the Son concerning His Mother’s
chastity, this is the rich heritage of Mary’s immaculate Virginity,
this is the consummation of the entire work. He spake thus, and _gave
up the ghost_, crowning the whole mystery with a good end of filial
duty.

7\. We have also read and perused the whole of the instructions, as well
what relates to Senecio being joined with our brother and fellow-bishop
Bassus in the government of his Church, as what relates to other
matters, and we now look for the direction of your sentence.

[^239]: He is sometimes spoken of as Bishop of Nairsus in Dacia
    Mediterranea (see Note in p. 67.) but Tillemont (note 43
    in Life of S. Ambrose) has made it probable that there
    were two Bishops of the name of Bonosus, one of Nairsus,
    and the other of Sardica, the latter of whom is the one
    dealt with by the Synod of Capua.
