# Letter of Gratian to Ambrose
**A.D. 379**

> IT is in answer to this that Letter 1 was written by S. Ambrose.
> It was written by the Emperor Gratian in his 20th year, four
> years after his succession to the Empire in partnership with his
> Uncle Valens and his younger brother Valentinian the 2nd, on the
> death of their father Valentinian the first, 375 A.D. Tillemont
> (Hist. des Emp. vol. v. p. 158.) calls it ‘une lettre toute
> pleine de piété et d’humilité, et d’ailleurs mesme écrite avec
> beaucoup d’esprit et d’elegance.’

```{centered} THE EMPEROR GRATIAN TO AMBROSE BISHOP OF ALMIGHTY GOD
```

1\. GREAT is my desire that as I remember you though far away, and in
spirit am present with you, so I may be with you in bodily presence
also. Hasten then, holy Bishop[^1] of God; come and teach me, who am
already a sincere believer; not that I am eager for controversy, or
seek to apprehend God in words rather than with my mind, but that the
revelation of His Godhead may sink more deeply into an enlightened
breast.

2\. For He will teach me, He Whom I deny not, but confess to be my God
and my Lord, not cavilling at that created nature in Him, which I see
also in myself. That I can add nothing to Christ I acknowledge, but I
am desirous by declaring the Son to commend myself to the Father also;
for in God I can fear no jealousy; nor will I suppose myself such an
eulogist as that I can exalt His divinity by my words. Weak and frail,
I proclaim Him according to my power, not according to His Majesty.

3\. I beg you to bestow upon me the Treatise[^2] you gave me before,
adding to it an orthodox discussion on the Holy Spirit: prove, I
beseech you, both by Scripture and reason, that He is God. God keep you
for many years, my father, servant of the eternal God, Whom we worship,
even Jesus Christ.

[^1]: The word in the original is Sacerdos. It is constantly
    used by S. Ambrose and other writers of his time for
    Bishops, though they sometimes add a qualifying epithet,
    ‘Summus Sacerdos.’ But even alone it is used where the
    writer is clearly speaking of Bishops, and of Bishops
    quâ Bishops. Thus it occurs frequently in the Proceedings
    of the Council of Aquileia, which is itself styled
    ‘Sacerdotale Concilium.’ See the Article ‘Bishop’ by Mr.
    Haddan in Dict. of Chr. Ant. Vol. 1 p. 210 b., who refers
    also to Bp. Taylor, Episc. Assert. § 27. It has therefore
    been rendered ‘Bishop’ throughout this volume, wherever
    it is plain that the reference is to Bishops, and ‘Priest’
    wherever it is used in a more general way.

[^2]: This forms the two first books of the ‘De Fide’ still
    extant among the works of S. Ambrose. The other three
    books were added afterwards, as S. Ambrose explains at the
    beginning of Bk. iii, to maintain his statements against
    the attacks of heretical teachers. The Treatise, ‘De
    Spiritu Sancto,’ in 3 books, was sent afterwards in
    381 A.D.
