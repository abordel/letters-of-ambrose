# Letter XVI
**A.D. 383**

> THIS letter is addressed to Anysius, immediately on his election
> as successor to Acholius, in answer apparently to one from
> Anysius, which accompanied that from the Bishops of Macedonia,
> and announced his appointment. He speaks of the responsibility
> of succeeding so zealous a Bishop as Acholius, whom he praises
> in enthusiastic terms, and prays that God may make him a worthy
> successor in every way.

```{centered} BISHOP AMBROSE TO HIS BROTHER ANYSIUS
```

1\. I HAVE been for some time sure of what I now read for the first
time, and I know well by his merits him whom my eyes have not seen.
I grieve that the one event should have happened, I rejoice that the
other has ensued; I should have wished that the one had not happened
in my lifetime, but it was my hope that after the death of that holy
man this alone would ensue, as it ought. So now we have you, once
the disciple, now the successor of Acholius of blessed memory, the
inheritor alike of his rank and of his grace. This is a great merit,
my brother. I congratulate you that there was not a momentâ€™s doubt who
should be the successor of so great a man. It is a great task too, my
brother, to have taken upon you the burden of so great a name, a name
of such weight, of such a scale. In you we look for Acholius, and as he
was in your affections, so in your ministry is required a copy of his
virtue, of his holy life, his vigorous mind in that decrepit body.

2\. I have seen him, I confess: my seeing him is due to his merits:
I saw him in such sort in the body as to believe him to be out of the
body: I saw the image of him who, knowing not whether it was in the
body or out of the body, saw himself transported to Paradise. With
such rapid speed had he traversed every region, Constantinople, Achaia,
Epirus, and Italy, that younger men could not keep pace with him. Men
of stronger bodies yielded to him, knowing that he was free from the
shackles of the body, so that he used it more as a covering than as
an instrument, at all events that it was his slave not his helpmate,
for he had so trained his body that he crucified the world in it, and
himself to the world.

3\. Blessed is the Lord, and blessed was His youth which He passed in
the tabernacle of the God of Jacob, abiding in a monastery, in which,
when sought after by His parents and relations He said, _Who is My
mother, and who are My brethren?_ I know not father, nor mother, nor
brethren, save those _who hear the Word of God, and do it_. Blessed
also were his maturer years, wherein he was elected to the chief
priesthood, having given proof of his virtue by a long service. He
came like David to restore peace to the people. He came like that ship
bringing with him spiritual treasure, and cedar wood, and precious
stones, and those _silver wings of a dove_, with which, lying _in the
midst of the lots_, she slept the sleep of tranquillity and peace.

4\. For even the sleep of the saints is operative, as it is written,
_I sleep, but my heart waketh_, and as holy Jacob saw in sleep divine
mysteries, which waking he saw not, even a passage opened for the
saints between earth and heaven, and the Lord regarding him and
promising to him the possession of that land. Thus by a brief sleep
he attained that which his successors afterwards won by great toil.
The sleep of the saints is free from all bodily pleasures, from all
perturbation of mind, it brings tranquillity to the mind and peace to
the soul, so that, freed from the fetters of the body, it raises itself
aloft, and is united to Christ.

```{margin}
**Wisd. iv. 9.**
```

5\. This sleep is the life of the saints, the life which holy Acholius
lived, whose old age was also blest. That old age is truly venerable
which is hoary not with gray hairs but in good deeds; for those hoar
hairs are reverent which belong to the soul, whose works and thoughts
are, as it were, white and shining. For what is true old age, but that
unspotted life, which lasts not for days or months but for ages, whose
continuance is without end, whose length of years is without weakness?
For the longer it lives the stronger it waxes; the longer its life
lasts the more vigorously does it grow unto a perfect man.

6\. May God then approve you his successor not only in honor but also in
conversation, and may He deign to establish you in His highest grace,
that the people may flock to you also, and you may say often, _Who
are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves with their young?_ Let
them come also as the ships of Tarshish, and take in corn which the
true Solomon gives, even twenty measures of wheat. Let them receive the
oil and wisdom of Solomon, and let there be peace between thee and thy
people, and keep thou the covenant of peace. Brother, farewell: love me,
for I too love you.
