```{centered} AMBROSE TO CERTAIN OF THE CLERGY
```

1\. IT is a fault which frequently besets the human mind, that, if
things do not at once fall out according to their wishes, they lightly
take offence, and desist from their duty. In other classes of men this
is tolerable, but in those who are devoted to the Divine service it is
a frequent cause of sorrow.

2\. There are certain persons in the clerical function, into whose minds
the Enemy, if he cannot otherwise deceive them, thus seeks to creep,
that he may instil evil thoughts of the following kind; ‘What does
it avail me to remain among the clergy, to suffer injuries, to bear
toil, as if my own farm could not support me, or, if I have no farm,
as if I could not otherwise obtain support?’ It is by such thoughts
as these that even good dispositions are withdrawn from their duty, as
if provision for his own sustenance was the only function of a cleric,
and not rather to purchase for himself the Divine assistance after
death. Whereas he only shall be rich after death, who on earth has
had strength to contend unharmed against the wiles of his numerous
adversaries.

3\. It is said therefore in Ecclesiastes, _Two are better than one,
because they have a good reward for their labour, For if they fall, the
one will lift up his fellow_. Where are the two that are better than
one, but where Christ is, and he whom Christ defends? For if he who is
with the Lord Jesus falls, Jesus raises him up.

4\. But in what sense is it said, _for their labour_? Is Christ then
weary[^294]? Yes truly, for He says, _I am weary of crying_. He labours,
but it is on us. Moreover after His toil He sat down wearied on the
well; but what is the mode of His labours? The Apostle by his own
humbler example has taught us in the words, _Who is weak, and I am not
weak?_ Our Lord Himself has also taught us in the words, _I was sick,
and ye visited Me not, naked and ye clothed Me not_. He labours, in
order to raise me in my falls.

5\. Hence in Elisha also our Lord is prefigured, for he stretched
himself upon the dead child that he might raise him to life, and in
this we have a symbol that Christ died with us, that He might rise
for us. Thus Christ placed Himself on the level even of our frailty,
that He might raise us again. He did not fall, but of His own will cast
Himself down, and in rising raised up His fellow. For He has taken us
into fellowship with Himself, being anointed, as it is written, _with
the oil of gladness above His fellows_.

6\. Well says the Preacher, _If they fall, the One_, not being Himself
lifted up, _will lift up his fellow_; for Christ needed not the
assistance and aid of another to raise Him, but rose by His own power.
Again, _Destroy_, He says, _this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up. But this He said of the Temple of His Body._ And it is well that
he who has not fallen should not be raised by another, for he who has
been so raised must have fallen, and he who has fallen needs assistance
that he may be raised. This is taught also by the words of Scripture
which follows, _Woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath
not another to lift him up_. Again, _if two lie together, then they
have heat_. For _we are dead with Christ, and therefore we also live
with Him_. And Christ has thus died that He might give us warmth, as
He has said, _I am come to send fire upon the earth_.

7\. I was dead, but because in Baptism I died together with Christ,
I received the light of life from Christ. And he who dies in Christ,
being warmed by Christ, receives the breath of life and resurrection.
The boy was cold, Elisha warmed him with his breath, and imparted to
him the warmth of life. He slept together with him that being thus
buried with him in a figure the warmth of his rest might raise him up.
He is cold then who dies not in Christ; he cannot be warmed to whom
no burning fire is applied; he who has not Christ with him cannot grow
warm by being near another.

8\. And that you may understand it to be said as a mystery and not in
reference to the bare number that _two are better than one_, he adds
a mystical saying, _A threefold cord is not quickly broken_. For that
which is threefold and uncompounded cannot be broken. Thus the Trinity,
being of an uncompounded nature, cannot be dissolved; for God is,
whatever He is, one and simple and uncompounded; and what He is that
He continues to be, and is not brought into subjection.

9\. It is a good thing therefore to adhere closely to that other One,
and to put your neck into His chain, and to bow down your shoulder and
bear Him, and be not grieved with His bonds; because He went forth from
the house of bondmen to assume His kingdom, that _Child who is better
than an older and foolish king_. Wherefore they who follow Him are
also bound with chains. Paul too is _the prisoner of Jesus Christ_.
And Jesus Himself _led captivity captive_. He thought it not enough to
destroy that captivity which the devil had imposed, so that he might
not again assault those who were wandering at large. But to dwell in
subjection to Christ, putting your feet into the fetters of wisdom, and
becoming His captive that you may be free from the adversary, this is
what He accounted perfect liberty.

10\. Rightly is He called a _Child_, for _unto us a Child is born_, and
truly a good Child to Whom it has been said by God the Father, _It is a
light thing that Thou shouldst be My Servant_; wise also, as the gospel
teaches us, for He _increased in wisdom and stature_; and properly
called poor, for, _though He was rich, for our sakes He became poor,
that we through His poverty might be rich_. Wherefore in His kingdom
He does not despise the poor man, but listens to him and frees him from
all straits and troubles.

11\. Let us then live in obedience to Him, that that _old and foolish
king_ may have no power over us. For he, desiring to reign and be
supreme after his own will, and not to be under subjection to the Lord
Jesus, grows old in sin, and falls into the deformity of folly. For
what can be more foolish than for a man to relinquish heavenly and
apply himself to earthly things, for him to neglect what is eternal,
and to choose the frail and perishing?

12\. Let no one then say, _We have no portion in Jacob nor inheritance
in Israel_. Let no one say, I am not among the Clergy, for it is
written, _Give unto Levi his lots_[^295]; and again David says that
he who _lieth in the midst among the lots_ ascends to heaven with
spiritual wings. Say not of your God, _He is grievous to us_, nor of
your place, it _is not for our turn_, since Scripture says, _Leave not
thy place_: For the adversary would fain deprive thee of it, he would
fain drive thee away, for he envies thee thy hopes and thy function.

13\. But thou that art in the lot of the Lord, His portion and
possession, depart not therefrom, that thou mayest say to Him, _For
Thou hast possessed my reins, Thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb_;
and that He may say to thee, as to a good servant, _Go, and sit down to
meat_.

Farewell, my sons: serve the Lord, for the Lord is good.
