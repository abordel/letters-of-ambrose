# Letter XI
**A.D. 381**

> THIS letter, which, like the previous one, is really
> addressed to Gratian, though in accordance with custom formally
> superscribed with the names of all the three Emperors, urges him
> to support Damasus as the orthodox and duly elected Bishop of
> Rome, and to condemn his rival Ursinus, whose interference with
> their Council, and intrigues with the Arian party they also
> inform him of.

```{centered} TO THE MOST GRACIOUS EMPERORS AND CHRISTIAN PRINCES, THE MOST GLORIOUS AND MOST BLESSED, GRATIAN, VALENTINIAN, AND THEODOSIUS, THE COUNCIL WHICH IS ASSEMBLED AT AQUILEIA
```

1\. YOUR enactments have indeed already provided, most gracious Princes,
that the perfidy of the Arians may not any further either be concealed
or diffused: for we do not conceive that the decrees of the Council
will be without effect; for as regards the West, two individuals
only have been found to dare to oppose the Council with profane and
impious words, men who had previously disturbed a mere corner of Dacia
Ripensis[^44].

2\. There is another subject which distresses us more, which, as we
were assembled, it was our business to discuss duly, lest it should
spread through the whole body of the Church diffused over the whole
world, and so trouble all things For though we were generally agreed
that Ursinus[^45] could not have overreached your piety (though he
allows nothing to be quiet, and amid the many urgencies of war would
press upon you with his importunity) still lest your holy tranquillity
of mind, which delights in having all persons in its care, should be
swayed by the false adulation of that unreasonable person, we think it
right, if you condescendingly allow it, to offer you our prayers and
entreaties, not only to guard against what may be, but shuddering at
past things also which have been brought about by his temerity. For if
he found any vent for his audacity, where would he not spread confusion?

3\. But if pity for a single person can sway you, much more let the
prayer of all the Bishops move you. For which of us will be united
to him in fellowship and communion when he has attempted to usurp a
place not due to him, and one he could not lawfully have arrived at,
and endeavours to regain in a manner most unreasonable what he was
most unreasonable in aiming at? Often as he has been found guilty of
turbulence, he still goes on, as if his past conduct should inspire
no horror. He was often, as we ascertained and saw in the present
Council, in union and combination with the Arians at the time when he
endeavoured in company with Valens[^46] to disturb the Church of Milan
with their detestable assembly: holding private meetings sometimes
before the doors of the synagogue and sometimes in the houses of the
Arians, and uniting his friends to them; and, as he could not go openly
himself to their congregations, teaching and informing them in what
way the Church’s peace might be disturbed. Their madness gave him fresh
courage, so as well to earn the favour of their supporters and allies.

4\. When therefore it is written; _a man that is an heretic after[^47]
one admonition reject_, and when another man who spoke by the Holy
Spirit has said that beasts such as these should be spurned and not
received with greeting or welcome, how is it possible that we should
not judge the person whom we have seen united to their society to be
also a maintainer of their perfidy? What even if he were not there? We
might still have besought your Graces not to allow the Roman Church,
the Head of the whole Roman world, and the sacred faith of the Apostles
to be disturbed; for from thence flow all the rights of venerable
Communion to all persons. And therefore we pray and beseech you that
you would condescend to take from him the means of stealing advantage
from you.

```

5\. We know your Graces’ holy modesty: let him not press upon you words
unbecoming your ears, or give his noisy utterance to what is alien from
the office and name of a Bishop, or say to you what is unseemly. When
he ought to have _a good report_ even _from those who are without_,
let your Graces condescend to recollect what was the testimony with
which the men of his own city have followed him. For it is a shame to
say and against modesty to repeat how disgraceful is the rumour, with
the reproach of which he is wounded. The shame of this ought to have
constrained him to silence, and if he partook in any degree of the
feelings and conscience of a Bishop, he would prefer the Church’s peace
and concord to his own ambition and inclination. But, lost to all shame,
he sends letters by Paschasius an excommunicated person, the standard
bearer of his madness, and so sows confusion, and attempts to excite
even Gentiles and abandoned characters.

6\. We therefore entreat you to restore by the degradation of that most
troublesome person the security which has been interrupted both to us
Bishops and to the Roman people, which is at present in uncertainty
and suspense since the memorial of the Prefect of the city. And
on obtaining this let us in continuous and unbroken course offer
thanksgivings to God the Almighty Father and to Christ our Lord God.

[^44]: Dacia Ripensis. The original Province of Dacia was beyond
    the Danube. It was conquered and included in the Empire
    by Trajan. In the time of Aurelian it was abandoned again,
    and the Danube re-established as the frontier. Then the
    Roman colonists were removed to the South of the Danube,
    into the central district of Mœsia, which was then called
    Dacia Aureliani. This was afterwards divided into two
    Provinces, called Dacia Ripensis and Dacia Mediterranea,
    Ripensis being the northern part, extending along the bank
    of the Danube, whence the name.

[^45]: “Damasus was made Pope on the death of Liberius A.D. 366.
    Ursinus, called by some Ursicinus, was, as Damasus had
    been, Deacon at Rome, and could not endure the exaltation
    of his former colleague who is suspected of having taken
    part with Felix, the successor to the power of Liberius,
    when exiled by the Arians. Ursinus was factiously
    consecrated by one Bishop, and a contest ensued in which
    even much blood was shed. Ursinus was banished, and
    being recalled the next year, was banished again after
    two months. In 371 he was allowed to leave his place of
    exile, and only excluded from Rome and the suburbicarian
    provinces. In 378 he held the factious meetings mentioned
    in the letter, and was exiled to Cologne. He continued to
    petition Gratian to restore him, and hence the request of
    the Bishops at Aquileia.” Note in Newman’s Fleury vol. 1,
    p. 38.

[^46]: i. e. Julianus Valens, Bp. of Petavio, mentioned in the
    preceding letter.
