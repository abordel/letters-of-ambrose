# Letter LXXXIX

> A BRIEF acknowledgement of letters.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO ALYPIUS
```

1\. ANTIOCHUS, a man of consular rank, delivered to me your Excellencyâ€™s
letter; nor did I neglect to reply to it; for I sent you a letter by
my own messenger, and another occasion having offered, I sent, if I
mistake not, a second. But since the offices of friendship are rather,
I think, to be added to than balanced; it became my duty, especially
on his return who had laid upon me such a debt of obligation by your
letters, to make some return in the way of my own correspondence, that
so I might stand clear with both of you, and he with you, bound as he
was to bring you back what he had brought from you.

Farewell; love me, who love you.
