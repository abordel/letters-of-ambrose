# Letter LXXXVIII
  
> A FRIENDLY letter of commendation of Priscus.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO ATTICUS
```

1\. YOU entrusted my friend Priscus with a letter, which he delivered
to me, and I now give mine in turn to Priscus. Continue to love Priscus,
as you do, and even more than before; this I advise, because I also
value my Priscus highly. For I feel towards him that ancient love,
which from our childhood upwards has grown together with our years; but
it is long since I saw him before, so that not only in name but from so
long an interval of time he came to me as truly Priscus.

Farewell: love me your lover, for I also love you.
