# Letter LXXXVI

> S. AMBROSE speaks briefly in praise of Priscus.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO SIRICIUS
```

1\. WHEN Priscus, my friend and co-equal in age, was coming here, you
gave him a letter to me, and now that he is returning I give him the
reply which I send both to duty and affection. By this service he
has recompensed us both, for he has given me yours, and you mine, and
therefore ought to reap the reward of this his service by an increase
of favour.

Farewell, my brother; love me, for I love you.
