```{centered} AMBROSE TO SEVERUS, BISHOP
```

1\. JAMES, our brother and fellow-presbyter, has come from the depths of
Persia, and chosen the coast of Campania and your pleasant abodes for
his resting-place. You see in what spot he has anticipated for himself
the enjoyment of a haven sheltered, as it were, from the storms of this
world, where, after his long toils, he may spend the remainder of his
life.

```{margin}
**Ps. xxiv. 2.**
```

2\. For your coast, removed not only from danger, but from all tumult,
fills the senses with tranquillity, and transports the mind from the
fearful and raging billows of care to an honourable rest. So that those
words of David concerning the holy Church, which belong in common to
all, appear to be especially fitting and appropriate to yourselves;
_For He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods_.
For a mind undisturbed by inroads of barbarians and the evils of war,
has leisure for prayer, devotes itself to the service of God, cares for
the things of the Lord, cherishes those things which belong to peace
and tranquillity.

```{margin}
**Hab. iii. 7.**
```

3\. We meanwhile, exposed to the outbreaks of the barbarians and the
storms of war, are tossing in the midst of troubles, and from these
toils and dangers can only gather that those of our future life will
be still more grievous. Wherefore that saying of the Prophet seems to
accord with our condition, _I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction_.

```{margin}
**Ps. cxx. 5.**

**1 Cor. ii. 15.**
```

4\. For since I have now lived in the body fifty and three years, among
the shadows of this world, whereby the truth of future perfection is
obscured, and have already endured such heavy afflictions, am I not
camping in the tents of Cushan, and having my habitation among the
dwellers of Midian? For these, owing to their consciousness of their
darksome works, dread being judged even by mortal men, _but he that is
spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man_.

Farewell, my brother; love me, as indeed you do, for I also love you.
