# Letter LXIII
**A.D. 396**

> THIS, the longest and latest, and certainly not the least
> interesting, of S. Ambrose’s Letters, is addressed to the
> Church of Vercellæ, which, owing to intestine divisions, had
> been for some time without a Bishop. S. Ambrose first urges
> them to remember Christ’s Presence among them, and to proceed
> to Election with that thought especially in their minds. He then
> speaks of two follows of Jovinian, Sarmatio and Barbatianus, who
> had introduced their evil doctrines among them, and so fostered
> divisions. This leads him to dwell at length on the evils of
> sensuality and the benefits of self-denial, on the profit of
> fasting, and the excellence of a virgin life, and bids them
> ‘stand fast,’ and not be led astray by false teachers. Then he
> recurs to the subject of the election of a Bishop, and bids them
> lay aside all evil feelings, and choose one worthy of so high
> an office, setting before them the examples of our Lord Himself,
> of Moses and Aaron. He then speaks of the qualities to be looked
> for in a true Bishop, and urges them to choose one worthy to
> succeed to the see of the holy martyr Eusebius, and, recurring
> to the examples of the old Testament, dwells on the history of
> Elijah. He ends by a general exhortation to all the Church of
> Vercellæ to the chief Christian virtues, after the model of
> S. Paul’s Epistles, to which the outline of this letter bears a
> general resemblance. Some questions as to its genuineness have
> been alluded to in the notes. There seems no sufficient reason
> for doubting that it is a genuine letter of S. Ambrose. It is
> thoroughly Ambrosian in style and method, and in its treatment
> of Scripture, especially of the history of the old Testament and
> of the lives of the great saints of the old dispensation. It was
> written not more than a year before S. Ambrose’s death.

```{centered} AMBROSE, SERVANT OF CHRIST, CALLED TO BE BISHOP, TO THE CHURCH OF VERCELLÆ, AND TO THEM WHO CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, GRACE UNTO YOU FROM GOD THE FATHER AND HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON BE FULFILLED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
```

1\. I AM overcome by grief that the Church of the Lord, which is among
you, has still no Bishop, and alone in all the regions of Liguria and
Æmilia, of Venetia[^253] and the adjacent parts of Italy, stands in
need of those ministrations which other Churches were wont to ask at
her hands, and, what causes me still more shame, the contention[^254]
which causes this delay is ascribed to me. For as long as there are
dissensions among you, how can either we determine anything, or you
make your election, or any man accept the election, so as to undertake
among men who are at variance an office difficult to bear the weight of,
even among those that agree?

2\. Are you the scholars of a confessor, are you the offspring of those
righteous fathers, who as soon as they saw holy Eusebius[^255], though
before he was unknown to them, put aside their own countrymen, and
forthwith approved of him; and required no more than the sight of him
for their approval? Rightly did he who was chosen unanimously by the
Church, turn out so eminent a man, rightly was it believed that he whom
all demanded was chosen by the judgment of God. It is fitting therefore
that you follow the example of your fathers, especially since it
behoves you, who have been trained by so holy a Confessor, to be better
than your fathers, forasmuch as you have been trained and taught by a
better preceptor; and to show forth a visible sign of your moderation
and concord, by unanimously agreeing to the choice of a Bishop.

```{margin}
**S. Matt. xviii. 19, 20.**
```

3\. If the Lord has said, _If two of you shall agree as touching any
thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father
which is in heaven: For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, there am I in the midst of them_; how much less, when many are
assembled in the name of the Lord, where all agree together in their
petitions, how much less ought we in any wise to doubt that there
the Lord Jesus will be present to inspire their will and grant their
petition, to preside over the ordination and confer the grace?

4\. Make yourselves therefore worthy that Christ should stand in the
midst of you; for wheresoever is peace there is Christ, for Christ is
_Peace_; wheresoever is righteousness there is Christ, for Christ is
_Righteousness_. Let Him stand in the midst of you, that you may see
Him, that it be not said to you also, _There standeth One among you,
Whom ye know not_. The Jews saw Him not, for they believed not on Him;
we behold Him by devotion, and Him by faith.

```{margin}
**Ps. xix. 1.**

**Acts vii. 56.**
```

5\. Let Him therefore stand in the midst of you, that you may have the
_heavens_ which _declare the glory of God_, opened to you; that you may
do His will and work His works. The heavens are opened to him who sees
Jesus, as they were opened to Stephen, when he said, _Behold I see the
heavens opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God_. Jesus
stood as an intercessor, He stood, as being eager to assist His soldier
Stephen in his combat; He stood as being prepared to crown His martyr.

```{margin}
**Dan. vii. 9, 10.**

**Ps. lxxxii. 1.**
```

6\. Let Him therefore stand in the midst of you, that you may not
fear Him when seated on His throne, for seated thereon He will judge,
according to the saying of Daniel, _I beheld till the thrones were
cast down, and the books were opened, and the Ancient of days did sit_.
And in the 82nd Psalm it is written, _God standeth in the congregation
of princes, He decideth among gods_. So then being seated He judges,
standing He decides. He judges concerning them that are not perfected,
He decides among the gods. Let Him stand for you as a Defender, as the
good Shepherd, that cruel wolves may not attack you.

**1 Cor. ix. 27.**
```

7\. Nor is it without reason that my admonition directs itself to this
point; for I hear that Sarmatio and Barbatianus[^256] have come among
you, vain boasters, who assert that there is no merit in abstinence,
no grace in a strict life, none in virginity, that all are to be rated
at one price, that they who chastise their flesh, in order to bring it
into subjection to the body, are beside themselves. But had the Apostle
Paul thought it a madness, he never would have practised it himself,
nor written it for the instruction of others. Yet he thus glories,
saying, _But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest
that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself be found
a reprobate_[^257]. So that they who chastise not their own bodies, yet
would fain preach to others, are themselves accounted reprobates.

```{margin}
**1 S. John ii. 19.**
```

8\. For is there aught so reprobate[^258] as that which excites us
to impurity, to corruption, to wantonness? as the fuel of lust, the
enticer to pleasure, the nurse of incontinence, the incentive of
desire? What new school has sent forth these Epicureans? No school of
philosophers, as they affirm, but of ignorant men who are setters forth
of pleasure, who persuade to luxury, who hold chastity to be useless.
_They were with us, but they were not of us_, for we blush not to say
what the Apostle John said. It was when placed here that they first
fasted, within the monastery they were under restraint; there was no
room for licence, all opportunity of jesting and altercation was cut
off.

9\. This these men of delicacy could not bear. They departed, and when
they desired to return were not received, for I had heard many things
concerning them against which it behoved me to be on my guard; I
admonished them, but in vain. Thus they began to boil over and spread
abroad what might prove the miserable incentives of all kinds of
vice. Thus they lost the fruits of their fasting, they lost the fruits
of having contained themselves a little while. And now with Satanic
malice they envy others those good works, the fruits of which they have
themselves lost.

10\. What virgin can hear without grieving that her chastity will have
no reward? Far be it from her readily to give credence to this, still
less let her lay aside her earnestness, or change the intention of
her mind. What widow, were she to find her widowhood profitless, would
choose to preserve inviolate her first marriage-vow, and live in sorrow,
instead of allowing herself to be comforted? What wife is there who
hearing that no honour is due to chastity, might not be tempted by
unwatchful heedlessness of mind or body? And that is why the Church, in
her sacred Lessons, in the discourses of her priests, daily sends forth
the praises of chastity, the glory of virginity.

11\. Vainly then has the Apostle said, _I wrote to you in an Epistle
not to company with fornicators_: and lest perhaps they should say,
‘We speak not of the fornicators of this world, but we say that he
who has been baptized into Christ ought not to be deemed a fornicator,
but whatever his life may be, it will be accepted by God,’ the Apostle
has added; _Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world_,
and below, _If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or
covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
with such an one no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them
also that are without?_ And to the Ephesians, _But fornication, and
all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not once be named among you,
as becometh saints_, adding straightway, _For this ye know, that no
whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater,
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God_. This, it is
plain, is said of the baptized, for they receive an inheritance who are
baptized into the death of Christ, and are _buried together with Him,
that they may rise together with Him_. Wherefore they are _heirs of
God_, and _joint-heirs with Christ_, heirs of God because the Grace of
God is conveyed to them, and coheirs of Christ because they are renewed
according to His life; heirs also of Christ because by His Death He
grants to them as Testator His inheritance.

12\. Now such as these, who have somewhat to lose, ought more to take
heed to themselves than they who have nothing. These ought to act with
greater caution, to avoid the snares of vice and the incentives to sin,
which chiefly arise out of meat and drink. _The people sat down to eat
and drink, and rose up to play._

```{margin}
**Gen. iii. 1–4.**
```

13\. Even Epicurus himself, whose example these men prefer to that of
the Apostles, he, the champion of pleasure, while he denies that it
produces evil, denies not that certain consequences flow from it, from
which evils are generated: he maintains too that not even the life of
the licentious, which is filled with pleasures of this kind, can be
said to be objectionable, unless it be assailed by the fear of pain
or death. How far removed he is from the truth, may be discovered
even from this, that he declares pleasure to be the work of God in
man as its originator, as his follower Philomarus[^259] maintains in
his Epitomes, referring this opinion to the Stoics as its authors.

14\. But this is refuted by holy Scripture, which teaches us that
pleasure was instilled into Adam and Eve by the snares and enticements
of the Serpent. For the Serpent itself is pleasure, and, in accordance
with this, the passions of pleasure are various and slippery, and
infected by the poison, so to speak, of corrupt enticement. Hence it
is plain that Adam, deceived by the sensual appetite, fell from his
obedience to God, and the reward of grace. How then can pleasure recal
us to Paradise, when it alone cast us out of Paradise?

```{margin}
**S. Matt. iv. 2.**

**Ib. 3.**

**Ib. 4.**

**Ib. xvii. 21.**
```

15\. Wherefore the Lord Jesus, willing to strengthen us against the
temptations of the Devil, fasted before His combat, to teach us that
otherwise we cannot conquer the snares of evil. Moreover, the Devil
himself employed the force of pleasure in launching the first dart of
his temptations, saying, _If Thou be the Son of God, command that these
stones be made bread_. To which the Lord replies, _Man shall not live
by bread alone, but by every word of God_; nor would He do it, although
within His power, that He might teach us by this wholesome precept to
attend rather to love of reading, than to pleasure. Now seeing they
deny that we ought to fast, let them be prepared with some reason why
Christ fasted, unless it were that His fast might be an example to us.
Lastly in a subsequent instance He has taught us that except by fasting
evil cannot easily be conquered. These are His words, _This kind of
evil spirits goeth not out but by prayer and fasting_.

**Acts x. 10.**

**Exod. xxxiv. 28.**

**Dan. vi. 22.**

**Ib. ix. 2.**

**Tobit xii. 8, 9.**
```

16\. Or what can be the meaning of Scripture which teaches that Peter
fasted, and that it was while he was fasting and praying that the
mystery of the baptism of the Gentiles was revealed to him? what but
to convince us that the Saints themselves by fasting are advanced in
virtue? It was while fasting that Moses received the Law, and in like
manner, Peter, while fasting, was taught the grace of the New Testament.
To Daniel also it was vouchsafed through fasting to stop the mouths of
the lions, and to behold the events of times to come. Lastly, what hope
of salvation can there be for us, unless by fasting we wash away our
sins, since Scripture says, _Fasting and alms purge away sin_?

```{margin}
**1 Cor. xv. 32.**
```

17\. Who then are these new teachers who deny the merit of fasting?
Are they not heathen words which say, _Let us eat and drink_? And well
does the Apostle tell them, saying, _If after the manner of men I have
fought with the beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead
rise not? let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die_. That is to say,
What did it profit me to contend even unto death, save that I might
redeem my body? For in vain is it redeemed if there is no hope of the
resurrection. If therefore all hope of this is to be abandoned, let us
eat and drink, let us not lose the fruit of things present, seeing that
future things are not within our grasp. It is for those then to indulge
in meat and drink, who have nothing to hope for after death.

18\. Lastly, the Epicureans, the champions of pleasure, assert that
death is nothing to us: what is dissolved, they say, is insensible,
and what is insensible is nothing to us. By this they show plainly that
they live by the body only and not by the mind, and do not perform the
functions of the soul but of the body only, in that by separation of
soul and body they deem all their vital functions to be dissolved, the
merits of their virtues and all vigor of their souls to perish, that
with his bodily senses the whole man fails, and that, though the body
itself is not immediately dissolved, the mind leaves not a relic behind
it. Then they would have the soul perish sooner than the body, whereas
even according to their own opinion they ought to remember that the
flesh and bones remain after death; and, would they abide by the truth,
they ought not to deny the grace of the resurrection.

```{margin}
**Ib. 33, 34.**
```

19\. Well therefore does the Apostle, confuting these persons,
admonish us not to be overthrown by such opinions, saying, _Be not
deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners. Be sober[^260] unto
righteousness and sin not; for some are ignorant of God._ To be sober
then is good, for drunkenness is sin.

20\. But to Epicurus, this advocate of pleasure, him of whom we make
such frequent mention, in order to prove that these men are disciples
of the heathens, and follow either the sect of the Epicureans or the
man himself who was excluded even by philosphers from their company
as the pattern of luxury, what if we can prove even him to be more
tolerable than these men? Now he asserts, as Demarchus[^261] tells
us, that it is not drinking-bouts, nor banquettings, nor the birth of
sons, nor the embraces of women, nor a large supply of fish and such
delicacies provided for sumptuous feasts, it is not these which make
life sweet, but sober discourse. He added also that they who are not
excessive in seeking the dainties of the table, are moderate in the use
of them. The man who cheerfully limits himself to the juices of plants
and to bread and water, despises delicate feasts, for from these arise
many evils. Elsewhere too they say that it is not excessive banquets
and revels which make pleasure sweet, but a temperate life.

21\. Seeing then that philosphy has renounced these men, shall not the
Church exclude them? They themselves too, as is usual in a bad cause,
often attack themselves by their own arguments. For although it be
their main opinion, that there is no sweetness of pleasure but that
which arises from eating and drinking; yet, perceiving that they cannot
lay down so shameful a definition without the utmost disgrace, and that
none stand by them, they have sought to disguise it under the gloss
of colourable arguments, and thus one of them has said, In seeking
pleasure by means of feasting and song, we have lost that which is
derived from hearing that Word whereby alone we can be saved.

```{margin}
**Acts xvii. 18.**
```

22\. Do we not then perceive in this complicated discussion how
inconsistent and variable these men are? Scripture condemns them,
for it has not passed over those whom the Apostles confuted, as Luke
records in the Acts of the Apostles, which he has written in narrative
style, _Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans[^262], and of the
Stoics encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say?
other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods._

23\. Yet not even from this number did the Apostle part devoid of
success. For Dionysius the Areopagite, and Damaris his wife, with many
others, believed. And thus by their acts this assembly of the learned
and eloquent proved themselves vanquished by the simple discourse of
the faithful. What then do these men mean by attempting to pervert
those whom the Apostle has won, and Christ redeemed with His own blood,
insisting that the baptized have no need to apply themselves to the
exercise of virtue; that they are not injured by revellings, by excess
of pleasure; that they who deprive themselves of such things are
foolish; that virgins ought to marry and bear children; widows also
ought to renew that carnal commerce which they had better never have
known; and that although they might be able to contain themselves they
are mistaken in refusing again to enter into the bond of marriage?

24\. What then? Shall we put off the man and put on the beast? shall
we strip off Christ, and be clothed over and over with the garments of
Satan? The very heathen sages held that pleasure was not to be esteemed
honourable, lest they should seem to couple men with brutes, and can we
instil the habits of animals into the human breast, and engrave on the
rational mind the irrational instincts of wild beasts?

25\. Yet there are many kinds of animals, who when they have lost their
mate, will no longer copulate, but lead, as it were, a solitary life.
Many also feed on simple herbs and only quench their thirst in the pure
stream; you may also often see dogs refuse food which they have been
forbidden, and, if bid to refrain, close up their hungry jaws. Do men
then require to be recalled from that in which even mute animals have
learnt from man’s teaching not to transgress[^263]?

26\. But what is more excellent than abstinence, which makes even the
years of youth to be old, and produces an old age of conduct? For as
by excess of food and drunkenness even old age is inflamed, so on the
other hand, the insolence of youth is restrained by sparing food and
by the flowing stream. Fire without us is quenched by the pouring on
of water, no wonder then if even internal heat is allayed by draughts
from the brook; for the flame is nourished or fails, according as it
is fed or not. As hay, stubble, wood, oil, and the like are the fuel of
fire, and feed it, and if you withdraw or do not supply them the fire
is quenched, so also the warmth of the body is nourished or diminished
by food; by food it is excited and by food allayed. Gluttony therefore
is the mother of lust.

27\. And shall we not say that temperance is accordant with nature, and
with that Divine law, which in the very origin of all things, gave us
to drink of the fountains and to eat of the fruit of trees? After the
flood the just man found himself tempted by wine. Wherefore let us use
the natural drink of temperance, and would that we all could do so. But
since we are not all strong, the Apostle says, _Use a little wine for
thine often infirmities_. It is to be drunk then because of infirmity
not for pleasure, and therefore as a remedy, sparingly, not as a luxury,
profusely.

his head; and in the strength of that meat he fasted forty days_. Our
fathers, when they passed over the sea on foot, drank water, not wine.
It was when fed on their homely food and drinking water, that Daniel
repressed the rage of the lions, and the Hebrew children saw the fiery
furnace playing round their limbs with harmless flames.

29\. And why should I speak of men only? Judith, in no wise moved by
the luxurious banquet of Holofernes, won a triumph which men’s arms had
found desperate, by the sole merit of her temperance, delivering her
country from invasion, and slaying with her own hand the captain of the
host: a manifest example both that this warrior dreaded by the people
had become enervated by his luxury, and that temperance in food had
made this woman stronger than men. It was not in her sex that she
surpassed nature, but by her spare diet she conquered. Esther obtained
favour from the proud king by her fasts. Anna, _a widow of about
fourscore and four years_, serving in the temple _with fastings and
prayers night and day_, came to the knowledge of Christ, and John the
Teacher of abstinence, and, as it were, a new Angel upon earth, was His
herald.

30\. O foolish Elisha! to feed the prophets with wild and bitter gourds;
O Ezra[^264] unmindful of Scripture though from memory thou dost restore
Scripture! O senseless Paul, to glory in fasting, if fasting avails
nothing!

```{margin}
**Is. lviii. 11.**

**Ps. xxiii. 5. Vulg.**
```

31\. But how can that not profit whereby our vices are purged? And if
you offer it together with humility and mercy, then, as Isaiah has said
by the Divine Spirit, _thy bones shall be made fat, and thou shalt be
like a watered garden_! Thy soul then is fattened, and its virtues are
enriched by the spiritual fat of fasting, and thy fruits are multiplied
by the richness of thy mind, that thou mayest be made drunk, as it were,
with soberness[^265], as is that cup whereof the Prophet speaks, _And my
cup which inebriateth me, how goodly is it_!

```{margin}
**Ecclus. xviii. 30, 31.**

**Ib. xix. 2.**

**1 Cor. vii. 4.**
```

32\. But not only is that temperance praiseworthy which is sparing
in food, but that also which restrains desires. For it is written,
_Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites. If
thou givest thy soul the desires that please her, she will make thee
a laughing stock to thine enemies_! and again, _Wine and women will
make men of understanding to fall away_! Hence Paul teaches temperance
even in marriage; for he who commits excess therein is, as it were, an
adulterer, and violates the Apostolical law.

```{margin}
**Col. ii. 9.**
```

33\. But how can I express the greatness of the grace of virginity,
which was counted worthy to be chosen by Christ, to be the bodily
temple of God, wherein dwelt, as we read, _the fulness of the Godhead
bodily_! A virgin conceived the Saviour of the world, a virgin brought
forth the Life of the universe. Ought not then virginity to be above
all other states[^266] which was profitable to all in Christ? A virgin
bore Him Whom this world cannot contain or support. He, born of the
womb of Mary, preserved inviolate her chastity, and the seal of her
virginity. Therefore Christ found in the Virgin what He would take for
His own, what the Lord of all would assume to Himself. By the woman
and the man our flesh was cast out of Paradise, by the Virgin it was
re-united to God.

```{margin}
**Exod. xv. 20.**
```

34\. And what shall I say of the other Mary[^267], the sister of Moses,
who, leading the female band, passed on foot over the straights of the
sea? By the same grace Thecla was reverenced even by lions, so that the
unfed beasts, lying at the feet of their prey, underwent a holy fast,
neither with wanton look nor sharp claw venturing to harm the virgin,
for even by a look the sanctity of virginity is profaned.

```{margin}
**1 Cor. vii. 25.**
```

35\. Again, with what reverence has the holy Apostle spoken, _Now
concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give my
judgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord_. Commandment he
has not, but counsel; for that which is above the Law is not commanded,
but counselled and advised. Nor is any authority assumed, but grace is
shewn, and that not by any chance person, but by him who _hath obtained
mercy of the Lord_. Are then the counsels of these men better than
those of the Apostles? The Apostle says, _I give my counsel_, but they
dissuade all from leading a virgin’s life.

```{margin}
**Cant. iv. 12.**

**Eph. v. 27.**
```

36\. And we ought to wonder at the greatness of the commendation of
it which the Prophet, or rather Christ in the person of the Prophet,
has expressed in one short verse. _A garden inclosed is my sister,
my spouse, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed._ Christ says this
to the Church, whom He would have _a virgin without spot or wrinkle_.
Virginity is a fertile _garden_, which bears many fruits of a good
odour; _a garden inclosed_ because it is surrounded on all sides with
the wall of chastity; _a fountain sealed_, in that virginity is the
fountain and source of modesty, and that which keeps unbroken the seal
of purity; that fountain wherein is reflected the image of God, since
with chastity of body accords likewise holy simplicity.

```{margin}
**2 Cor. xi. 2.**

**1 Cor. vii.**
```

37\. Nor can any one doubt that the Church herself is a virgin, whom
even at Corinth the Apostle Paul espoused, that he _might present her
a chaste virgin to Christ_. Thus in his first Epistle he gives counsel
and sets a high value on the gift of virginity, for that it is not
disquieted by the needs of this present world, nor defiled by its
corruptions, nor agitated by its storms. In the latter he espouses the
Corinthians to Christ, that so, in the purity of that people, he may
ratify the virginity of the Church.

38\. Answer me now, O Paul, in what way _for the present distress_ dost
thou give counsel? _He that is unmarried_, thou sayest, _careth for
the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord_, adding
further, _the unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord_, that
she may be holy both in body and spirit. She has therefore a bulwark
against the storms of this world, and thus shielded and fortified
by the Divine protection she is disquieted by none of the blasts of
this world. Counsel then is good, because therein lies profit, but
in commandment is a bond[^268]. Counsel leads forward the willing,
commandment binds the reluctant. So that if any follow this counsel,
and repent not, she hath profited; on the other hand, if she change
her purpose, she hath no ground to accuse the Apostle, for she ought
to have judged better of her own weakness, and thus she is responsible
to herself for her own choice, for she has bound herself by a bond and
knot heavier than she can bear.

```{margin}
**Rom. xiv. 2.**

**1 Cor. vii. 37–40.**
```

39\. Wherefore, as a good physician, who desires both to preserve for
the strong the stability of their virtue, and to restore health to
the weak, he gives to the one counsel, to the other a remedy; _Whoso
is weak, let him eat herbs_; let him take a wife; he that is stronger,
let him use the strong meat of continence. And he well adds; _He that
standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power
over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep
his virgin, doeth well. So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth
well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. The wife is
bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be
dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment, and I think also
that I have the Spirit of God._ Now having the counsel of God consists
in examining all things diligently, in urging what is best, and
pointing out what is safest.

40\. A careful guide points out many ways, that each person may walk on
which he will, and which he finds suitable for himself: provided only
he lights on one which will lead him into the camp. Good is the way of
virginity, but, being lofty and steep, it requires the stronger sort.
Good too is the way of widowhood, not so difficult as the former, but,
being rocky and rough, it requires the more cautious sort. Good too
is the way of matrimony, but, being smooth and direct, it arrives by
a longer circuit at the camp of the faithful, and this way is trodden
by the larger number. We have therefore the rewards of virginity, the
merits of widowhood, there is also a place for conjugal chastity. They
are the degrees and advances of several virtues.

41\. Stand stedfast therefore in your hearts, that no man may unsettle
or overthrow you. The Apostle has taught us what ‘to stand’ signifies,
that is, what was said to Moses, _For the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground_; for no one stands but he who stands by faith, who
stands firm in the resolution of his heart. In another place too we
read, _But as for thee, stand thou here by Me_. Both are addressed
to Moses by the Lord, both _the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground_, and _stand thou here by Me_, that is to say, ‘thou standest
with Me, if thou standest in the Church. For the place itself is holy,
the land itself bears the fruit of holiness, and is rich with the
haunts of virtue.’

42\. ‘Stand therefore in the Church, stand where I appeared to thee,
there I am with thee. For where the Church is, there is the most secure
resting-place for thy soul; there is the support of thy mind, when I
appeared to thee out of the bush. Thou art the bush, I am the fire: the
fire in the bush, and I in the flesh. And therefore am I the fire, that
I may give thee light, that I may burn up thy thorns, that is, thy sins,
and discover to thee My grace.’

**Ps. xxvi. 4.**

43\. Stand firm therefore in your hearts, and drive away from the
Church those wolves which seek to carry off prey. Let there be no sloth
in you, nor an evil mouth or bitter tongue. Sit not with vain persons,
for it is written, _I have not dwelt with vain persons_. Listen not to
those who detract from their neighbours, lest, hearing others, ye be
yourselves excited to do likewise, and it be said to each of you, _Thou
satest and spakest against thy brother_.

**Ps. cxxxiv. 1, 2.**
```

44\. Sitting we speak against others, but standing up we praise the
Lord, as it is said; _Behold now, praise the Lord, all ye servants
of the Lord; ye that stand in the house of the Lord_. He who sits, to
speak of the habit of the body, is, as it were, dissolved by ease, and
relaxes the energy of his mind. But the careful watchman, the unwearied
scout, the wakeful sentinel who keeps the outposts of the camp, these
stand. The brave warrior also, who would prevent the designs of his
enemy, stands[^269] ready in his rank ere he is looked for.

45\. _Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall._ He who stands is
free from detraction, for it is by the talk of the idle that slander
is disseminated and rancour displayed. Wherefore the Prophet says, _I
have hated the congregation of the wicked, and will not sit among the
ungodly_. And in the 37th Psalm, which is full of moral precepts, he
has placed in the very outset, _Be not malignant among them that are
malignant, neither be thou envious against the evil-doers_. Malignity
does more harm than malice, for its property is neither pure simplicity
nor open malice; but a hidden malevolence, and it is more difficult to
guard against what is concealed than against what is known; and so our
Saviour bids us beware of evil spirits, for they captivate us by the
outward show of charming pleasures, and the false show of other things,
holding forth honour as a lure to ambition, wealth to riches, power to
pride.

```{margin}
**Prov. xiv. 30. LXX.**

**S. Matt. ix. 12.**
```

46\. Wherefore in every act, but especially in the search after a
Bishop, by whose model the life of all is formed, malignity ought to be
absent, that by a composed and peaceful exercise of judgment he may he
preferred to all who is to be chosen from all and who may heal all. For
_a gentle-minded man is the physician of the heart_, of that whereof
our Lord also in the Gospel has professed Himself a Physician, _They
that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick_.

```{margin}
**Heb. v. 5.**

**Ib. 7.**
```

47\. He is the good Physician, Who has taken upon Him our infirmities,
Who has healed our sicknesses, and yet He, as it is written, _glorified
not Himself to be made an High Priest_, but _He that said unto Him_,
even the Father, _Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee, as
He saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedeck_. And as He was to be the type of all priests,
He took upon Him our flesh, that _in the days of His flesh, He might
offer up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears
unto_ God the Father, _and though He were the Son_ of God, might even
_learn obedience from the things He suffered_, in order to teach us,
that He might become to us the Author of salvation. Finally, having
accomplished His sufferings, and being Himself made perfect, He gave
health to all, He bore the sin of all.

```{margin}
**Numb. xvii. 8.**

**Heb. v. 2.**

48\. Thus He Himself chose Aaron the High Priest, that human ambition
might not sway the choice, but the grace of God; no voluntary offering,
nor taking upon himself, but a heavenly call, that he might offer gifts
for sins, who could have compassion on sinners _for that he himself
also_, it is written, _is compassed with infirmity_. A man should
not _take this honour to himself, but he that is called of God as was
Aaron_; so also Christ did not assume but received His priesthood.

```{margin}
**Ib. vii. 2, 3.**

**Rev. i. 8.**
```

49\. And further, since the succession derived by descent from Aaron
produced heirs of his race rather than partakers of his righteousness,
therefore there came the antitype of that Melchisedeck whom we read of
in the Old Testament, the true Melchisedeck, the true King of Peace,
the true King of Righteousness, for this is the interpretation of his
name; being _without father, without mother, without descent, having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life_, which also has reference
to the Son of God, for in His Divine generation, He had no mother, and
in His birth from the Virgin Mary He knew no father; Who, born of the
Father alone before the world, and from the Virgin alone in the world,
could have no beginning of days, for He _was in the beginning_. And how
could He have any end to His life, Who is the Author of life to all?
He is _the Beginning and the Ending_. But this is referred to also by
way of example, that a Bishop ought to be without father and without
mother, in that it is not nobility of birth, but holiness of life and
preeminence in virtue that is chosen in him.

50\. Let him possess faith and ripeness of conduct, not one without
the other, but let both continue in one, with good works and deeds.
Wherefore the Apostle Paul wishes us to be imitators of those who _by
faith and patience possess the promises_ of Abraham, of him who by
patience was counted worthy to receive and possess the grace of the
blessing promised to him. The prophet David has admonished us that we
ought to be imitators of holy Aaron, for he has proposed him to us,
among the saints of the Lord, as an example for our imitation, saying,
_Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon
His Name_.

51\. An example worthy to be followed by all truly was he, seeing
that when death, owing to the rebels, was spreading among the people,
he placed himself between the living and the dead, thereby to arrest
death so that no more might perish. Of a priestly mind and temper truly
was he, who thus with pious zeal offered himself, as a good Shepherd,
for the Lord’s flock. Thus he broke the sting of death, checked its
violence, refused to let it pass. Thus piety aided his services,
because he offered himself for those who resisted.

52\. Wherefore let those also who separate themselves learn to fear the
anger of the Lord, and to appease His priests. What? did not the earth
open and swallow up Dathan Korah and Abiram on account of their schism?
For when Korah Dathan and Abiram stirred up two hundred and fifty men
against Moses and Aaron to separate themselves from them, they rose up
against them, saying, _Let it suffice for you that all the congregation
are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them_.

```{margin}
**2 Tim. ii. 19.**
```

53\. Wherefore the Lord was angry and spake to the whole congregation.
_The Lord knoweth them that are His_, and hath drawn His saints to
Himself; and those whom He hath not chosen, He has not so drawn to
Himself. And the Lord commanded that Korah and all those who together
with him had rebelled against Moses and Aaron, the priests of the Lord,
should take censers, and put incense therein, that he who was chosen of
the Lord, might be declared to be holy among the ministers of the Lord.

```

54\. And Moses said unto Korah, _Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi,
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel hath
separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to
Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord?_ and below,
_Seek ye the priesthood also? for which cause both thou and all thy
company are gathered together against the Lord: and what is Aaron that
ye murmur against him?_

55\. The whole people therefore, weighing the cause of offence, that
these men, though unworthy, wished to fill the office of the priesthood,
and therefore separated themselves, murmuring against the Lord, and
censuring His judgment in the choice of their priests, were seized with
great fear, and oppressed with apprehension of punishment. But at the
general entreaty that all may not be involved in destruction through
the insolence of a few, the guilty are marked out, and two hundred and
fifty men with their leaders are separated from the rest, the earth
quakes and is rent asunder in the midst of the people, a deep gulf is
opened and swallows up the offenders, and thus they are removed from
the pure elements of creation, so as neither to pollute the air by
breathing it, nor the heavens by looking on them, nor the sea by their
touch, nor the earth by their burial.

56\. The punishment ceased, the wickedness ceased not; for owing to
this very act a murmuring arose among the people that by means of the
priests the people had perished. Indignant at this the Lord would have
destroyed all, had He not first been moved by the prayers of Moses and
Aaron, and afterwards, at the intercession of Aaron His priest, (in
order to render their pardon more humiliating,) consented to spare
their life at the prayer of those, whose prerogative they had denied.

57\. Miriam the prophetess herself, she who with her brethren had
crossed the straights of the sea dryshod, because, being still ignorant
of the mystery of the Ethiopian woman, she had murmured against her
brother Moses, became leprous white as snow, and even at the prayer
of Moses was scarcely healed of this great plague. This her murmuring
however is to be considered as a type of the Synagogue, which,
uninstructed in the mystery of this Ethiopian woman, that is, of the
Gentile Church, utters daily reproaches, and envies that people by
whose faith she herself will also be relieved from the leprosy of her
unbelief, according as we read, _that blindness in part is happened to
Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in_.

58\. And that we may observe that it is Divine rather than human grace
which operates in priests, of all those rods which Moses received from
the tribes and laid by, the rod of Aaron alone budded, and thus the
people perceived that the Divine commission is a gift which is to be
looked for in a priest, and though they before thought that a similar
prerogative belonged to themselves, they now ceased to claim the same
privilege for a merely human election. But this rod, what else does
it indicate, but that priestly grace never decays, and in the utmost
lowliness has in the exercise of its functions the flower of strength
committed to it, or because this also has reference to a mystery? Nor
is it without a meaning that we deem this to have taken place near the
end of the life of Aaron the priest. It appears to be intimated that
the ancient Jewish people, decaying and worn away by the long-continued
infidelity of their priesthood, will in the latter times be reclaimed
to zealous faith and devotion by the example of the Church, and by the
aid of reviving grace will again put forth the blossoms which have so
long been dead.

59\. But what is signified by the fact that on the death of Aaron it
was not to all the people, but to Moses alone, who is among the priests
of the Lord, that God gave the command to invest with the garments of
Aaron the priest Eleazar his son, what but to teach us that a priest
ought to be consecrated by a priest, and clothed with his proper
garments, that is, with priestly virtues; and then, when it appears
that he lacks no part of his priestly array, but is complete in all
things, that he should be brought near to the holy altars. For being
about to offer for the people, he ought to be chosen by the Lord,
and approved by the people; and this lest some grave cause of offence
should be found in him whose duty it is to intercede for the sins of
others. No ordinary degree of virtue befits a priest, for he ought
sedulously to shun not only more heinous sins, but even the smallest;
he ought to be open to compassion, not to revoke his promise, to raise
the fallen, to sympathise with sorrow, to preserve meekness, to love
piety, to drive away or stifle wrath, to be a trumpet to rouse the
people to devotion, or to soothe them into tranquillity.

60\. It is an old saying; Accustom yourself to be single-minded that
your life may be as a picture, and ever preserve the same stamp which
it has received. How can he be one and the same, who at one time is
inflamed with anger, at another, boils with bitter indignation, whose
countenance burns and then changes to paleness, varying and changing
colour every moment. But suppose that it is natural to be angry, or
that for the most part there is cause to be so; it also is the part of
a man to moderate his wrath, and to resist being carried away by brutal
fury, so as not to know how to be appeased; it is his duty not to
embitter family discord, for it is written, _A wrathful man diggeth
up sin_. He is not one with himself who is double-minded, nor he who
cannot restrain his wrath, of whom David says well, _Be ye angry, and
sin not_. Such a one does not command his anger, but rather indulges
his natural passions, which cannot indeed be prevented but may be
moderated. Although then we are angry, let our passion admit only such
emotion as is according to nature, not sin which is contrary to nature.
For it is intolerable that he who undertakes to govern others should be
unable to govern himself.

```{margin}
**1 Tim. iii. 2.**

61\. And so the Apostle has given us a model, that it behoves a _Bishop_
to be _blameless_, as he also says elsewhere, _For a Bishop must be
blameless, as the steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry,
not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre_. For how can
the compassion of the almsgiver and the avarice of the coveter agree
together?

```{margin}
**Ib. 9.**

**Ib. 6.**
```

62\. I have set down those things which I have learnt are to be avoided;
it is the Apostle who teaches what virtues are needed, and he tells us
that the _gainsayers_ are to be _convinced_ with patience, and commands
a Bishop to be _the husband of one wife_, and this not in order to
exclude him from marriage, (for this is beyond the bounds of the
precept,) but that by conjugal chastity he may preserve the grace of
his Washing; nor again, that he may feel that he has the sanction of
Apostolical authority for begetting children after he is a priest, for
he speaks of one having children, not of one begetting them or marrying
again.

63\. And I have thought it better to touch upon this, because many
persons argue as if the being _husband of one wife_ had reference to
a man marrying once after Baptism, seeing that by Baptism all the sin
which would interpose any obstacle is removed. True indeed it is that
in Baptism all sins and offences are washed away, so that even to one
who has polluted his body with many women not united to him by wedlock,
all is remitted. But Baptism does not dissolve marriage, if a man has
married again, for it is sin, not the Law, which is destroyed by the
Bath, and in marriage there is no sin but a law. Being therefore a
law it is not dissolved as if it were a fault, but retained, in that
it is a law. Now the Apostle has laid down a rule saying, _If any be
blameless, the husband of one wife_. So that if any man be blameless,
the husband of one wife, he comes under the forms of the rule for
undertaking the priestly office, but he who marries again incurs not
indeed the sin of pollution, but loses the prerogative of a priest.

64\. We have declared what the law prescribes, let us speak also of what
is prescribed by reason. But in the first place we are to understand
that the Apostle has not ordained this with reference to Bishops and
Presbyters only, but that the Fathers of the Nicene Council[^270] have
also decreed that no man should be a cleric at all who has contracted a
second marriage. For how can he give consolation or honour to a widow;
how can he exhort her to continue a widow, or to preserve that faith
to her husband which he has not preserved to his own first marriage?
Or what difference would there be between the people and the priest,
if they were bound by the same laws? The life of the priest ought to
be pre-eminent as well as his graces, for he who obliges others by his
precepts ought himself to observe the precepts of the law.

```{margin}
**1 Tim. iii. 6.**
```

65\. How vehemently I resisted ordination! and when I was at last
constrained to consent, how I strove that it might be postponed! but
the popular impulse[^271] prevailed over prescribed[^272] rules. And yet
it was approved by the judgement of the Bishops of the West, and its
example followed by those of the East[^273]; and this notwithstanding
the prohibition to ordain a _novice, lest he be lifted up with pride_.
If my ordination was not postponed, it was owing to a constraining
force, and if proper humility be not wanting to the priest, where the
fault does not lie with him no blame will be imputed.

66\. But if even in other Churches such deliberation is used in
ordination, how much care is required in that of Vercellæ, where two
duties seem equally required of the Bishop, monastic severity and
ecclesiastical discipline. For Eusebius of blessed memory was the
first to bring together in the West these two differing requisites,
and though living in the city observed the monastic institute, and
with the government of his Church united the sobriety of an ascetic
life. Great increase accrues to the grace of the priesthood when young
men are thus obliged to practise abstinence and to obey the laws of
chastity, and, though living within the city, to renounce its customs
and ways.

67\. Hence sprung those famous men Elijah, Elisha, and John the son
of Elizabeth, who clothed _in sheepskins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented, wandered about in deserts_, in mountains thickets and
precipices, among pathless rocks, in horrid caves, through marshy fords,
_of whom the world was not worthy_. Hence Daniel, Ananias, Azarias and
Misael, who were brought up in the royal palace, were fed sparingly as
though they had been in the desert, with coarse food and water to drink.
Rightly then did the king’s servants prevail over kingdoms, shake off
the yoke and set at nought captivity, _subdue kingdoms_, conquer the
elements, _quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword,
stop the mouths of lions, out of weakness were made strong_, shrank not
from the _mockings_ of men, seeing that they hoped for heavenly rewards,
nor dreaded the darkness of the prison, since on them had shone the
brightness of eternal light.

68\. Following their example, holy Eusebius[^274] left his country and
kindred, and preferred foreign sojourn to the enjoyment of home. For
the faith’s sake he also chose and desired the hardships of exile,
having for his companion Dionysius of blessed memory, who chose a
voluntary banishment in preference to the Emperor’s friendship. Thus
when these illustrious men, beset by arms, hemmed round by soldiers,
were being carried off from the greater church, they triumphed over the
imperial power. Troops of soldiers and the din of arms could not rob
them of their faith, but they subdued the fierceness of the brutal mind,
depriving it of power to hurt the Saints. _For_, as it is written in
Proverbs, _the king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion_.

69\. He confessed himself vanquished, by requesting them to relinquish
their purpose, but they deemed their pen of reeds more powerful than
his iron swords. Thus it was unbelief, not the faith of the Saints,
which was wounded and fell: they for whom a heavenly abode was prepared
needed not a sepulchre in their own country. They wandered through
the world _as having nothing, yet possessing all things_. Every place
whither they were sent appeared full of delights, nor could they
feel any want who always abounded in faith. They were tempted but not
overcome, in fastings, in labours, in watchings, in prisons; _out of
weakness they were made strong_. Fed to the full by fasting they looked
not for the charms of pleasure; refreshed by the hope of eternal grace,
the burning summer parched them not, nor did the cold of icy regions
break them down; for the warm breath of devotion invigorated them; they
feared not the bonds of men, for Jesus had loosed them; they desired
not to be redeemed from death, for they looked forward to be raised
again by Christ.

70\. Holy Dionysius again prayed that his life might close in exile,
fearing that, if he returned, he should find the minds of the clergy or
people perplexed by the doctrines and customs of the unbelieving, and
he won this grace and carried with him with calm mind the peace of the
Lord. Thus as holy Eusebius first lifted up the standard of confession,
so blessed Dionysius, dying in his exile, won a higher title even than
martyrdom.

71\. Now this endurance in holy Eusebius throve under the monastic
discipline, and by being accustomed to a stricter rule, he imbibed a
power of bearing hardships. For it is certain that in the higher kinds
of Christian devotion these two things are the most excellent, the
Clerical function and the Monastic rule. The first is trained to be
obliging and courteous in its behaviour, the second is accustomed to
abstinence and endurance; the one lives as on a theatre, the other in
secret; the one is seen, the other hidden. It is the saying of one who
was a noble combatant, _We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to
Angels_. Worthy truly was he to have Angels as his spectators, when he
wrestled that he might attain the prize of Christ, when he contended
that he might lead on earth an Angel’s life, that he might overcome
the wickedness of spirits in heaven, for _he wrestled with spiritual
wickedness_. Rightly was the world a spectator of him whom it was
called on to imitate.

the lusts of the flesh; the one subdues, the other flees from corporal
pleasures; the one regulates, the other refrains itself, for to the
perfect it is said, _If any man will come after Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me_. Now he follows Christ

received of the Lord Jesus_. And though many stood round him, weeping

a more signal victory; the other falls less frequently and more easily
keeps guard over itself.

Jezebel threatened him, Elijah feared and rose up, _and went in the
strength of that_ spiritual _meat forty days and forty nights unto
Horeb the mount of God_; and he came thither unto a cave, and lodged
there, and afterwards was sent from thence to anoint kings. Thus he
was inured to endurance by dwelling in the desert, and as though fed

of holy Elijah’s dwelling in the desert, the names of places which are
not without meaning, let us return to consider this. Elijah was sent
to the brook Cherith, there the ravens fed him, in the morning they
brought him bread, in the evening flesh. And with reason did they bring
him bread in the morning, for _bread strengthens man’s heart_, and
it was with mystical food that the prophet was fed. In the evening he
was supplied with flesh. Understand what thou readest; for Cherith is
understanding, Horeb signifies, ‘heart’ or ‘as heart;’ of Beersheba the
signification is the ‘well of the seventh,’ or ‘of the oath.’

78\. Elijah first went to Beersheba, to the mysteries and sacraments
of the Divine and holy Law, afterwards he was sent to the Brook, to
the stream of that _river_ which _makes glad the city of God_. Here
you perceive the two Testaments, and their single Author; the ancient
Scriptures as a deep and dark well whence you have to draw water with
difficulty, for He Who was to fill it full was not yet come, as He
said in after times, _I am not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil
it_. Therefore the Saint is commanded by the Lord to pass over the
brook, for he who shall drink of the New Testament is not only a river,
but _out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water_, rivers of
understanding, rivers of meditation, spiritual streams, which yet are
dried up in time of unbelief, lest the profane and faithless should
drink of them.

79\. And there the ravens acknowleged the Lord’s prophet whom the
Jews acknowleged not. They fed him whom that royal and noble nation
persecuted. Who is Jezebel who persecuted him, but the Synagogue,
vainly flowing, vainly abounding in the Scriptures, which it neither
keeps nor understands? Who are the ravens that fed him, but they whose
young ones call upon Him, to whose cattle He _giveth fodder_, as we
read, _and feedeth the young ravens that call upon Him_. These ravens
knew whom they were feeding; for they had a spiritual intelligence, and
brought food to that stream of sacred knowledge.

80\. He too feeds the prophet who understands and keeps what is written.
Our faith supports him, our advance gives him nourishment; he feeds on
our minds and senses, his discourse is sustained by our understanding
of it. We give him bread in the morning, in that, placed in the light
of the Gospel, we bring to him the stablishing of our hearts. By these
things is he nourished and strengthened and fills the mouths of them
that fast, to whom the unbelief of the Jews administered no food of
faith. All prophetic words are fasting diet to them, for they cannot
discern its interior richness, to them it is food weak and thin, such
as cannot make fat their bones.

81\. Perhaps the reason why they brought him flesh in the evening
was that it is, as it were, stronger food, such as the Corinthians,
who were weak, could not bear, and were therefore fed with milk by
the Apostle; and thus in the evening of the world stronger meat was
brought, in the morning of the world bread. And so since it was the
Lord Who commanded this food to be administered to him, we may suitably
address Him in this place with these prophetic words, _Thou makest the
outgoings of the morning and evening to praise Thee_, and below, _Thou
preparest their corn, for so Thou providest for the earth_.

82\. But now I think we have said enough of the teacher, let us now
follow up the lives of his disciples, who have given themselves to
praise the Divine Name, and celebrate it with hymns night and day.
For this is the service of Angels, always to be praising God, and
with frequent prayers to propitiate and beseech the Lord. They give
themselves to reading, and occupy their minds with continual labours,
separated from all female society, they mutually protect each other.
What a life this is, wherein there is nothing you need to fear, but
much for you to imitate! The pain of fasting is repaid by tranquillity
of mind, alleviated by custom, made supportable by rest, or beguiled
by occupation; worldly solicitude does not burthen nor outward troubles
engross it, nor do the distractions of the city draw down upon it any
difficulty.

83\. For the maintenance or teaching of this gift an instructor is to
be sought: what kind of one he ought to be you perceive, and by your
unanimous aid we shall be able to obtain him, if you mutually forgive
one another, if any of you consider himself injured by the other. For
it is not the sole condition of virtue not to hurt him who has not hurt
you, but it consists also in forgiving him who has injured you. We are
generally injured by the fraud of others, by the guile of our neighbour,
but we must not deem it to be the part of justice to repay guile with
guile, and fraud with fraud. For if justice be a virtue, it must be
free from the imputation of crime, and not return evil for evil. For
what kind of virtue is it for you to do yourself what you punish in
another? This is merely to propagate iniquity, not to punish it; and
the character of the person whom you injure, whether he be just or
unjust, makes no difference, for you ought not to have done evil. Nor
does the mode of your ♦transgression signify, whether it proceed from
the desire of avenging yourself, or of injuring others, for in neither
kind are you free from blame. There is no difference between being
ungodly and unjust, and therefore it is said, _Fret not thyself because
of the ungodly, neither be thou envious against the evil-doers_,
and above, _I have hated the congregation of the wicked_. Thus he
comprehends all, without exception; he points to their wickedness
without enquiring for the cause.

84\. And what can be a better model than the Divine justice? For the
Son of God says, _Love your enemies_. And again He says, _Pray for them
which despitefully use you and persecute you_. So far does He remove
the love of revenge from the perfect, that he enjoins upon them charity
towards their persecutors. And as in the Old Testament He said, _To Me
belongeth vengeance, I will repay_, so in the Gospel He commands us to
pray for them that injure us, that He Who has threatened to punish them
may not do so. For He desires you to pardon of your own free-will, with
which He agrees according to His promise. And if you call for vengeance,
you know that the unrighteous is more severely punished by his own
thoughts, than by judicial severity.

85\. And as no man’s life can be free from adversities, let us take care
that they do not befal us by our own fault. For no man is condemned
more severely by another’s judgment than the foolish man, who is the
author of his own misery, is by his own. Wherefore let us avoid such
occupations as are troublesome and contentious, which bear no fruit,
but only bring obstacles. But we ought to see that we have no cause to
be ashamed either of our choice or of our act; for it is the part of
a prudent man, to guard against having to feel frequent sorrow for his
acts, since it is the prerogative of God alone never to repent. For
what is the fruit of justice but calmness of mind, or what does living
justly bring with it, but a life of tranquillity? According to the
model of the master will be the condition of the whole house. But if
this is required in a family, how much more in the Church, where both
rich and poor, bond and free, Greek and Scythian, noble and plebeian,
are all one in Christ Jesus.

86\. Let no man suppose that because he is rich more deference ought
to be shewn him. In the Church he is rich, who is rich in faith, for
the faithful have a whole world of riches. What wonder is it that the
faithful should possess the world, seeing he possesses the heritage
of Christ, which is more precious than the world? _Ye were redeemed
with precious blood_, is said to all, and not to the rich only. But
if ye would be rich, follow him who says, _Be ye holy in all manner
of conversation_. This is said not to the rich only but to all, for He
judges without respect of persons, according to the faithful testimony
of His Apostle. Wherefore, says he, _pass the time of your sojourning
here_ not in indulgence, nor pride, nor elation of heart, but _in fear_.
Upon this earth ye have received what is temporal, not what is eternal,
use therefore those temporal things as knowing that you must shortly
depart hence.

behind, and faith alone will accompany you; justice indeed, if faith
precede, will also be your companion. Why do riches entice you? Not
with _silver and gold_, not with silken vests and riches _were ye
redeemed from your vain conversation; but with the precious blood of
Christ_. He therefore is rich who is an _heir of God, and co-heir of
Christ_. Despise not then a poor man, it is He Who hath made thee rich.
Scorn not a needy man; _lo! the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him_.
Reject not a needy man; for Christ, when He was _rich became poor_, and
this for thy sake, _that by His poverty He might make thee rich_. Exalt
not thyself therefore, as though thou wert rich, for He sent forth His
disciples without money.

88\. And the chief of these said, _Silver and gold have I none_. He
glories in his poverty as if he shunned contamination. _Silver and
gold_ he says, _have I none_, he does not say, gold and silver, for he
who knows not the use of these things knows not the relative value of
them. _Silver and gold have I none_, but faith I have. I am rich enough
in the name of the Lord Jesus, which is above every name. Silver I have
none, nor do I ask for it, gold I have not, nor do I desire it, but I
have that which ye that are rich are without, which even ye esteem of
more value, and this I give to the poor, namely, to say in the name of
Jesus, _Strengthen ye the weak hands and lift up the feeble knees_.

89\. But if ye would be rich, become poor. For ye shall in all things
be made rich, if ye become poor in spirit. It is not money but the
disposition which makes a man rich.

90\. There are those who humble themselves when riches abound, and this
is well and prudently done, for the law of nature is enough for all,
and what suffices to her is easily found, but where lust is, there, in
the abundance of riches, is still poverty. And no man is born poor, but
becomes so. Thus poverty lies not in nature but in our notions of it,
and therefore to find riches is easy to nature, but difficult for lust.
In proportion to man’s gains this thirst for gain increases, and he is,
as it were, inflamed by the intoxication of his lusts.

91\. Why do ye seek to accumulate riches as though they were necessary?
Nothing is so necessary as to know what is not necessary. Why do ye
cast the blame upon the flesh? it is not the lust of the belly, but the
desires of the mind which make a man insatiable. Is it the flesh which
blots out the hope of the future; is it the flesh which takes away the
sweetness of spiritual grace; is it the flesh which obstructs faith;
is it the flesh which in every way defers to the frantic domination
of vain opinions? The flesh loves rather that frugal temperance, which
relieves it of its burthen, which endues it with health, for so it rids
itself of keen anxiety, and obtains for itself tranquillity.

92\. But riches in themselves are not blameable. For _the ransom of a
man’s life are his riches_, for he who gives to the poor, redeems his
soul. There is therefore scope for virtue even in these material riches.
Ye are as it were pilots, in a great sea. If any man steers well his
ship, he quickly passes over the sea, and reaches his haven, but he who
cannot manage his property is sunk together with his burthen. Wherefore

93\. And what is this city but Jerusalem, which is in heaven, in which
is the kingdom of God? Good is this possession, which brings perpetual
fruit. Good is this possession, which we do not leave behind us, but
possess in heaven. He who finds himself in this possession says, _The
Lord is my portion_. He says not, My portion stretches and extends
itself to such and such limits. He says not, My portion is among such
and such neighbours, unless haply with reference to the Apostles, the
prophets and the saints of the Lord, for these are the portion of the
just. He says not, My portion is in the meadows, or in the woods, or
in the fields, less perchance in the fields of the wood, wherein the
Church is found, of which it is written, _We found it in the wood_.
He says not, Troops of horses are my portion, for _a horse is counted
but a vain thing to save a man_. He says not, Herds of oxen asses or
sheep are my portion, except so far as he numbers himself among those
herds _know their owner_, and with that ass which shuns not the _crib_
of Christ; that lamb too is his portion which was _brought to the
slaughter_, and _that sheep which before her shearers was dumb, which
opened not his mouth; by whose humility judgment has been exalted_. And
it is rightly said, _before her shearers_ because, on that Cross He put
off what was but accidental, not part of His essence, for He put off
His body, but lost not His Divinity.

94\. It is not every one therefore who can say _the Lord is my portion_.
Not the covetous man, for avarice comes and says; Thou art my portion,
I have thee in subjection, thou art my slave, thou hast sold thyself
to me with that gold, thou hast adjudged thyself to be mine with
these goods. The sensual man says not, Christ is my portion, because
luxury comes and says, Thou art my portion, I have brought thee into
subjection to myself by that banquet, I have caught thee by the snare
of those feasts, I keep thee in my bondage by the constraints of thy
gluttony. Wilt thou not acknowledge that thou didst set a higher value
on the indulgence of thy appetite than on thy life? I condemn thee by
thine own judgment; deny it if thou canst; but thou canst not. Again,
thou hast reserved nothing for thy subsistence, thou hast spent it all
on thy table. The adulterer cannot say, _The Lord is my portion_, for
lust comes and says, I am thy portion, thou hast enslaved thyself to me
by the love of that damsel, by a night spent with that harlot thou hast
committed thyself to my dominion. The traitor cannot say, _Christ is my
portion_, because his wickedness immediately seizes upon him and says,
He is deceiving thee, O Lord Jesus, this man is mine.

95\. We have an example of this, for, when Judas had received the sop
from Christ, the devil entered into his heart, as claiming him for his
own possession, retaining his right to his own portion, and saying,
This man is not Thine but mine; my servant, Thy betrayer; to me, then,
he manifestly belongs. With Thee he sits at table, but it is I who
feed him, from Thee he has received bread, from me money; with Thee he
drinks, but to me he has sold Thy Blood. And the event proved how truly
he spoke. Then Christ departed from him, and Judas also left Jesus, and
followed the devil.

bound with chains, but voluntary ones, chains which do not bind but
loose, chains in which they glory, saying, _Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ, and Timothy_. Bondage under Him is more honourable than freedom
and release from others. Who then would fly from peace, who would fly
from salvation, who would fly from pity, who would fly from redemption?

97\. Ye see, my sons, what they have become who have followed this
course, how they, though dead, still work. Now we join in praising
their virtue, let us also study to attain to their diligence, and
silently recognize in ourselves that which we speak of with approval
in others. Nothing effeminate, nothing frail can deserve praise, _The
kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force_.
Our fathers ate the Paschal lamb in haste. Faith makes good speed,
devotion is lively, hope unwearied; it loves not perturbations of
the soul, but it loves to pass from profitless inactivity to fruitful
labour. Why put off till to-morrow? you may still gain to-day; beware
lest you fail to attain the one, and lose the other also. The loss even
of one hour is not unimportant; one hour forms part of our whole life.

98\. There are some young persons who wish straightway to arrive at old
age, that they may no longer be subject to the will of their elders,
and there are old men who would return if they could to youth. Now
I can approve of neither of these desires; the young men, disdaining
things present, desire that their life may be changed, the old men that
it may be prolonged. But it is in the power of the young to become old
by gravity of mind, and of the old to grow young by vigorous actions.
For it is not age so much as discipline which brings with it correction
of life. How much more therefore ought we to lift up our hopes to the
kingdom of God, where our life will be renewed, and where there will be
a change not of age but of grace.

99\. It is not by indolence or sleep that we obtain for ourselves a
reward. The sleeper cannot work, there comes no fruit from indolence,
but rather loss. Esau, being slothful, lost the first-fruits of
blessing, choosing to receive rather than to seek for food. The
industrious Jacob found grace at the hands of both his parents.

100\. But Jacob, although superior in virtue and grace, gave way to his
brother’s anger, who was indignant that his younger brother should be
preferred to him. Wherefore it is written, _Give place unto wrath_, to
the intent that displeasure against another may not draw you also into
sin, while wishing to resist and to be avenged. If you will consent to
yield you may remove the blame both from yourself and from him. Imitate
the patriarch, who by his mother’s advice went into a far country. And
who was this mother? Rebecca, that is, patience. For who could give
this counsel but patience? The mother loved her son, and chose that
he should be separated from herself rather than from God. And thus as
a good mother she gave benefits to both her sons, but on her younger
son she conferred a blessing which he had power to keep. For she did
not prefer one son to the other, but she preferred diligence to sloth,
faith to unbelief. And even on her elder son she conferred no little
favour, for she sent away the younger, to save him from unworthy
fratricide.

101\. His piety not his fault having thus banished him from his parents,
he conversed with God, he increased in his estate, in his children,
in grace. Nor was he elated by these things on meeting with his
brother, but he humbled himself and did obeisance, not to his brother,
implacable as he was, but to God Whom in his person he honoured.
Therefore he bowed down to him seven times, being the number which
signifies remission, for it was not a man that he adored, but Him of
Whom He foresaw in spirit that He should come in the flesh, _to take
away the sins of the world_. And this mystery is unfolded to you in the
reply of Peter, who says, _How oft shall my brother sin against me and
I forgive him, till seven times?_ Thus you see this forgiveness of sins
is a type of that great sabbath, of that perpetual rest of grace; and
therefore it receives the gift of contemplation.

102\. But what is the meaning of his setting in array his wives, and
sons, and all his servants, and commanding them to bow themselves
to the earth? It was not to the earth, as an element, which is often
filled with blood, which is the receptacle of crimes, and which is made
hideous by desolate rocks, or by precipices, or by a barren and hungry
soil, but as that Flesh Which was to be our salvation. And perhaps this
is that mystery which the Lord has taught thee in the words, _I say not
unto thee, until seven times, but, until seventy times seven_.

a good teacher, has left us an example in the words, _For the love that
I had unto them, lo! they take now the contrary part, but I give myself
unto prayer_, and so when men reviled him, he prayed. Prayer is a good
shield, a shield which wards off contumely, which repels curses, and
throws them back on the heads of those who utter them, so that they are
wounded by their own weapons: _Let them curse_, it is said, _but bless
Thou_. That curse of men is to be courted, for it obtains for us a
blessing from the Lord.

for your city is Jerusalem, which is above. Do ye dwell there that ye
may say, _For our conversation is in heaven_. Jesus went forth from
the city, that ye, going forth from the world, may be above the world.
Moses alone, who saw God, had his tabernacle without the camp when he
talked with God; and when sacrifices were offered for sin, the blood
indeed was carried to the altar, but the bodies were burned without
the camp; for no man living among the temptations of this world can lay
aside sin, nor can his blood be accepted by God until he has put off
the defilement of this body.

to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting_. From the one
we win the merit of discharging a duty, from the other the stain of a
transgression. And again in the one case the reward is yet hoped for,
in the other it is received. Sympathise with those who suffer as if ye
suffered together with them.

107\. Let a woman be obedient not servile to her husband, let her offer
herself to be ruled not coerced. Let the husband also direct his wife
as her governour, honour her as the companion of his life, share with
her as his fellow-heir in grace.

108\. Mothers, wean your own children, love them, and pray for them,
but pray that their life[^275] may be prolonged above this earth, rather

109\. Mary, the mother of the Lord stood by the cross of her Son; it is
no other than the holy Evangelist John who teaches me this. Others have
told us that in the Lord’s passion the earth was shaken, the heaven
covered with darkness, the sun withdrew its light, the thief, after
a faithful confession, was received into paradise. John has taught
what the others have not, how when nailed to the Cross He spoke to His
mother, esteeming rather this exhibition of pious offices to His mother
than that gift of a heavenly kingdom, which, after triumphing over His
pains, He conferred. For if it be pious to grant pardon to the thief,
much more pious is it that the Son should shew such solicitous honour
to His Mother: _Behold_, He says, _thy son, Behold thy mother_. Christ
testified from the Cross, and distributed the offices of piety between
the mother and the disciple. The Lord made not only a public but also a
private Testament, and John signed this His Testament, a witness worthy
of so great a Testator, a good Testament, not of money but of eternal
life, written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God, Who
says, _My tongue is the pen of a ready writer_.

```{margin}
**Ib. lxxxviii. 4, 5.**

110\. Nor did Mary fall below what became the Mother of Christ. When the
Apostles fled she stood before the Cross, and with pious eyes looked
upon the wounds of her Son, for she expected to see not the death of
her Offspring, but the salvation of the world. Or perhaps because she
who was the Palace[^276] of the King had learnt that the redemption of
the world would ensue from the death of her Son, she thought that by
her own death she might add something to the general good. But Jesus
needed no helper for the redemption of all, Who without any helper
saved all. Wherefore He says, _I am become like a man without help;
free among the dead_. He received the affection of His Mother, but He
sought not aid from others.

111\. Imitate her, ye holy mothers, who in her only and beloved Son
exhibited such an example of maternal virtue, for your children cannot
be dearer to you than hers was, nor did the Virgin seek consolation in
the bearing of another son.

112\. Masters, command your servants not as your inferiors in rank, but
as remembering that they are partakers of the same nature as yourselves.
Servants also, serve your masters cheerfully, for every one ought
cheerfully to endure that state whereunto he is born; and obey not
only the good, but also the froward. For what merit has your service,
if ye serve the good diligently; but if ye serve the froward also
ye have merit, for neither do the free obtain any reward, if, having
transgressed, they are punished by the judges, but herein lies their
merit if they suffer wrongfully. Thus if ye, considering Jesus Christ,
serve even austere masters with patience, ye will have your reward. For
the Lord Himself suffered, the just from the unjust, and with admirable
patience nailed our sins to His Cross, that he who shall imitate Him
may wash away his sins in His blood.

113\. In short, turn all of you to the Lord Jesus. Take pleasure in this
life so that it be with a good conscience; let the hope of immortality
make you patient of death, let your assurance of the resurrection be
confirmed by the grace of Christ; let there be truth and simplicity,
faith and confidence, abstinence and holiness, industry and sobriety,
modest conversation, learning without vanity, sobriety of doctrine,
faith not intoxicated by heresy. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all, Amen.

[^253]: The word here used is plural, Venetiarum. From this it has
    been argued that this letter must be of later date than S.
    Ambrose’s time, as Venetiæ is the usual name for the city,
    which was not founded till the time of Attila. (Gibbon
    ch. xxxv. vol. iv. p. 242 ed. Smith.) But he certainly uses
    the plural form in Letter xviii. 21, which is undoubtedly
    his, and therefore, as Tillemont has pointed out, no
    argument can be founded on this against the present letter.
    It is possible that under the plural form he intends to
    include Venetia and Histria, which are reckoned together
    as one consular province in the civil division of the
    empire, (see Marquardt’s Table, in Smith’s Gibbon vol. ii.
    p. 315.) and also as one ecclesiastical province in the
    Exarchate of Milan, (see Bingham ix. 1, 6.) By ‘finitimis
    Italiæ partibus’ he probably means Flaminia and Picenum
    Annonarium, which were also included in the ‘Diocese’ of
    Italy and Exarchate of Milan.

[^255]: It is to be noted that Eusebius, who died in A.D. 371, was
    not the last Bishop of Vercellæ, but Limenius, whose name
    occurs among the Bishops who took part in the Council of
    Aquileia. This has also been made an argument against S.
    Ambrose’s authorship, but there does not seem much weight
    in it. Eusebius was much the more famous man of the two,
    and his teaching and example and the memory of his labours
    and martyrdom are naturally appealed to by S. Ambrose.

    Diog. Laert. x. 3. as a follower of Epicurus, and is also
    spoken of by Cicero, De fin. 11, 35. and by Horace, Sat. 1,
    2, 21.

[^260]: sobrii estote. Vulg.

[^261]: Nothing is known of Demarchus, whom S. Ambrose here quotes.
    The Benedictines suggest that it may be a mistake for
    Hermarchus, who was Epicurus’ successor as head of his
    school, and who wrote books in defence of the Epicurean
    philosophy. He is mentioned several times by Cicero.

[^262]: Though the so-called Epicureans of later days perverted
    his theory to what is generally known as Epicureanism,
    Epicurus himself certainly did not mean by pleasure
    sensual pleasure. ‘Pleasure was not with him a momentary
    and transitory sensation, but he conceived it as something
    lasting and imperishable, consisting in pure and noble
    mental enjoyments.’ ‘He was a man of pure simple and
    temperate habits.’ Dict. of Biog. in voc. Vol.ii. p. 34, 35.

[^263]: This must be the sense if we retain the interrogation.
    If it is omitted the passage would mean, ‘Men then are
    recalled from that, in which’ &c., i. e., it is plainly
    unfitting for men to do that, in which &c.

[^264]: S. Ambrose is alluding apparently to Ezra proclaiming and
    keeping a fast to remove God’s anger against his people.
    Should we not read ‘memoriae’ for ‘memoriâ?’ Ezra did
    restore the Scriptures _to_ the memory of the people, but
    it does not appear that he restored them _from_ memory?

    tractatus,’ which may mean ‘the Council which made the
    Nicene Creed,’ (for the phrase ‘Nicaenus tractatus’
    as applied to the Creed see note 1 on Acts of Council
    of Aquileia.) Another reading is ‘in Concilii Nicaeni
    tractatu,’ and another ‘in Concilio Nicaeno tractatus.’

    There is a difficulty about S. Ambrose’s statement,
    as there is nothing on the subject in the Canons of
    Nicaea. The Benedictine editors, after discussing other
    explanations, suggest that S. Ambrose may have had an
    inaccurate copy of the Canons, with the one he here
    quotes inserted from some other Council. Some unauthentic
    documents professing to give Nicene regulations on the
    subject are quoted in Dict. of Christian Antiq. Art.
    Digamy.

[^271]: impressio.

[^272]: praescriptio.

[^273]: The most conspicuous instance was Nectarius. See note 54,
    on Letter xiii.

[^274]: Eusebius and Dionysius Bishop of Milan were driven into
    exile by the Emperor Valens, because they refused at
    the third Council of Milan, A.D. 355, to subscribe the
    condemnation of Athanasius. There is a brief but graphic
    account of the circumstances in Bright’s History of the
    Church, pages 70–73.

[^275]: longaevi super terram.

[^276]: The expression ‘aula regalis,’ applied to the Mother of
    our Lord, may be illustrated from De Instit. Virg. ch. xii.
    § 79. Ipse ergo Rex Israel transivit hanc portam, ipse Dux
    sedit in ea, quando Verbum caro factum est et habitavit
    in nobis, quasi Rex sedens in aula regali uteri virginalis.
    Compare also the expression in S. Ambrose’s Hymn on the
    Nativity, Procedit e thalamo suo, Pudoris aula regia, &c.
