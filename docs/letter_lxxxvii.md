# Letter LXXXVII

> A LETTER of commendation.

```{centered} AMBROSE TO BISHOPS SEGATIUS AND DELPHINUS
```

1\. MY son Polybius, on his return from Africa, where he discharged the
duties of the proconsulship with credit, passed some days with us, and
inspired my heart with singular affection towards him.

2\. Then, when he wished to go from hence, he requested me to write
to both of you. I promised to do so, and having dictated a letter
delivered it to him superscribed with both your names. He asked for
another; but I said that I had directed this to both of you according
to our custom and usage, forasmuch as your holy minds are gratified
not by the number of letters but by the association of names, and that,
united as you were in feeling, you would not allow yourselves to be
separated in name; farther, that to employ this compendious form of
love was a prescribed part of my duty.

```{margin}
**Philem. i. 1.**
```

3\. Why need I say more? He asked for another, and I gave it, but so as
neither to deny him what he asked, nor to change my accustomed mode of
action. Thus he has a letter to deliver to each of you, for this was
all he put forward, his having nothing for one, when he had delivered
his letter to the other. And this office of undivided affection I may
render to you without any danger of offence, or thought of division;
especially since this form of writing is Apostolical, so that either
one may write to many as Paul to the Galatians, or two to one, as we
read, _Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
Philemon_.

Health to you; love me and pray for me, for I love you.
