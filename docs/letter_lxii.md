```{centered} AMBROSE TO THE EMPEROR THEODOSIUS
```

1\. ALTHOUGH I lately wrote to your Clemency even a second time, still
I was not satisfied to fulfil my duty of corresponding with you letter
by letter; for your gracious benefits have so often laid me under
obligation that by no services can I pay my debt to your Majesty, most
blessed Emperor.

2\. The very first occasion ought not therefore to have been omitted,
but through your chamberlain I ought to have offered to you my thanks,
and laid before you the expression of my duty; and this that my
omitting to write previously might not seem to arise from sloth rather
than necessity: I had also to inquire for some mode whereby I might
offer to your Goodness my proper and dutiful greeting.

3\. Rightly then do I send my son Felix the Deacon, to convey to you my
letter, and to offer to you in my name both my dutiful respects, and
also a memorial in behalf of those who, suing for mercy, have fled to
the Church, the Mother of your piety. Their tears have constrained me
to anticipate your Clemencyâ€™s mind by my petition.

4\. Our request is indeed a great one, but it is addressed to one on
whom the Lord has bestowed unheard-of and wonderful things, to one
whose mercifulness we have experienced, and whose piety we have as a
hostage. We confess then that we look for even more, for as you have
surpassed yourself in valour, so also you must surpass yourself in pity.
For your victory is considered to have been bestowed on you in the
primitive manner, and miraculously, as it was on Moses, on holy Joshua
the son of Nun, on Samuel and on David, not by human respect but by the
outpouring of celestial grace. Wherefore we look for a measure of pity
corresponding to that by means of which such a victory has been earned.
