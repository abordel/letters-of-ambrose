```{centered} AMBROSE TO FELIX, HEALTH
```

1\. ALTHOUGH not in a good state of bodily health, I derived no little
alleviation from the perusal of words from a heart so congenial to my
own, being refreshed by your discourse as by some soothing potion[^9];
and also by your announcement that the day memorable for us both
was at hand, that whereon you took on yourself the office of the
high-priesthood of which I was just then speaking with my brother
Bassianus[^10]. For having begun to speak of the dedication of the
Church which he had built in the name of the Apostles, we were led to
the subject, for he said that he earnestly desired the company of your
Holiness.

2\. Wherefore I introduced the mention of your birthday[^11], as being on
the first of November, and that it was (if I mistook not) close at hand,
and to be celebrated on the following day, so that after that it would
yield you no excuse. So I made a promise on your behalf; for you too
have liberty to do the same as regards me; I made a promise to him, and
exacted one for myself: for I feel assured you will be present, because
you ought to be. It will not therefore be so much my promise that will
bind you, as your own purpose, having resolved to do that which you
ought. You see then it was rather my knowledge of you, than any rash
confidence which induced me to give this pledge to my brother. Come
then, lest you put two bishops to shame; yourself for not coming, me
for having promised unadvisedly.

3\. But we will remember your birthday in our prayers, and do you not
forget us in yours. Our spirit shall accompany you; do you also, when
you enter the second Tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies,
do as we do, and carry us also in with you.

When in spirit you burn incense on the golden censer, forget us not;
for it is the one which is in the second Tabernacle, and from which
your prayer, full of wisdom, is directed to heaven as incense.

4\. There is the _Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold_;
that is, the doctrine of Christ, the doctrine of the Wisdom of God.
There is _the golden pot that had manna_, the depository, namely, of
spiritual nutriment, and the store-place of divine knowledge. There
is _the rod of Aaron_, the symbol of priestly grace. Before, it had
withered, but it _budded_ again in Christ. There are _the Cherubim_
over the tables of the Covenant, that is, the knowledge of the sacred
Lessons. There is the _Mercy-seat_, over which on high is God the Word,
_the Image of the invisible God_, Who says to thee, _I will commune
with thee from above the Mercy-seat, between the two Cherubim_, for He
speaks thus with us, that we may understand His saying, or because He
speaks things not earthly but spiritual, as He saith, _I will open My
mouth in a parable_. For where Christ is, there are all things, there
is His doctrine, there the remission of sins, there grace, there the
separation of the living and the dead.

5\. Aaron indeed once stood in the midst, interposing himself to prevent
death passing over to the hosts of the living from the carcases of the
dead. But He, as the Word, ever stands within each of us, although we
see Him not, and separates the faculties of our reason from the carcase
of our deadly passions and pestilential thoughts. He standeth as He Who
came into the world to blunt the sting of death, to stop its devouring
jaws, to give to the living an eternity of grace, to the dead a
resurrection.

6\. In His service you are warring a good warfare, His deposit you keep,
His money you lend out at interest, as it is written, _Thou shalt lend
unto many nations_; the good interest of spiritual grace, which the
Lord when He comes will exact with usury; and when He finds that you
have dispensed it well, He will give you for few things, many things.
Then shall I reap most delightful fruit, in that my judgment of you
is approved; the ordination which you received by the imposition of
my hands and the benediction in the Name of the Lord Jesus will not be
blamed. Work therefore a good work, that in that day you may receive
a reward, and we may rest together, I in you and you in me.

7\. _Plenteous is the harvest_ of Christ, _but the labourers few_, and
helpers are difficult to be found. So it was of old, but the Lord is
powerful, Who will _send labourers into His harvest_. Without doubt
among the ranks of the people of Comum[^12] very many have already begun
to believe by your ministry, and through your teaching have received
the word of God. But He Who gave those who believe will also give
them that will help: whereby all occasion will be removed for excusing
yourself for your postponed visit, and thus also the grace of your
presence will be more frequently shed around me.

Farewell: continue to love us, as you do.

[^10]: Bassianus is mentioned among the Bishops who took in the
    Council of Aquileia, as Bishop of Laus Pompeia, now Lodi
    Vecchio, S.E. of Milan. The modern town of Lodi is about
    5 miles from the site of the ancient one.

[^11]: He means the day of his consecration as Bishop. So S. Ambr.
    speaks of his own consecration day as his birthday, Comm.
    in Luc. vii. 78.

[^12]: Comum is the modern Como, at the southern extremity of the
    Lake which takes its name from it.
