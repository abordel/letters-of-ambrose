```{centered} BISHOP AMBROSE TO THE MOST BLESSED PRINCE AND GRACIOUS EMPEROR, HIS MAJESTY VALENTINIAN
```

1\. THE honourable[^77] Symmachus, Prefect of the city, having
memorialised your Majesty that the altar, which had been removed from
the Senate-house at Rome, ought to be restored to its place, and your
Majesty, whose years of nonage and inexperience are yet unfulfilled,
though a veteran in the power of faith, not having sanctioned the
prayer of the heathen, I also as soon as I heard of it presented a
petition, in which, though it embraced all that seemed necessary to be
said, I requested that a copy of the Memorial might be furnished to me.

2\. Now therefore, not as doubting your faith, but as providing for
the future, and assured of a righteous judgement, I will reply to
the allegations of the Memorial, making this one request, that you
will not look for elegance of phrases but force of facts. For as Holy
Scripture teaches us, the tongue of learned and wise men is golden, and
endowed with highly-decked words, and glittering with splendid elegance
as with the brightness of some rich colour, and so captivates and
dazzles the eyes of the mind with a shew of beauty. But this gold, if
closely handled, may pass current outwardly, but within is base metal.
Consider well, I beseech you, and sift the sect of the Heathens; their
professions are grand and lofty, but what they espouse is degenerate
and effete, they talk of God but worship idols.

3\. The propositions of the honourable Prefect of the city, to which
he attaches weight, are these, that Rome (as he asserts) seeks the
restoration of her ancient rites, and that stipends are to be assigned
to her priests and Vestal virgins, and that it was owing to these being
withheld that a general famine has ensued.

4\. According to his first proposition, Rome utters a mournful complaint,
wanting back (as he asserts) her ancient ceremonies. These sacred rites,
he says, repelled Hannibal from the walls, the Gauls from the Capitol.
But even here, in blazoning the efficacy of these rites, he betrays
their weakness. According to this, Hannibal long insulted the Roman
religion, and pushed his conquest to the very walls of the city, though
the gods fought against him. Why did they for whom their gods fought,
allow themselves to be besieged?

5\. For why speak of the Gauls, whom the remnant of the Romans could not
have prevented from entering the sanctuary of the Capitol, if the timid
cackling of a goose had not betrayed them. These are the guardians of
the Roman temples! Where was Jupiter then? Did he speak in a goose?

6\. But why should I deny that their sacred rites fought for the Romans?
Yet Hannibal also worshipped the same gods. Let them choose therefore
which they will. If these rites conquered in the Romans, they were
vanquished in the Carthaginians, but if they were thus overcome in the
case of the Carthaginians, neither did they profit the Romans.

```{margin}
**Wisd. iv. 9.**
```

7\. Away then with this invidious complaint of the Roman people; Rome
never dictated it. It is with other words that she addresses them: ‘Why
do you daily deluge me with the useless gore of the innocent flocks?
The trophies of victory depend not on the limbs of cattle, but on the
strength of warriors. It was by other powers that I subdued the world.
Camillus was my soldier, who recovered the standards which had been
taken from the Capitol, and slew those who had captured the Tarpeian
rock; valour overthrew those against whom religion had not prevailed.
Why should I name Regulus, who gave me even the services of his death?
Africanus gained his triumph not among the altars of the Capitol,
but among Hannibal’s ranks. Why do you produce to me the rites of
our ancestors? I abhor the rites of the Neros. What shall I say of
the two-month Emperors[^78], and the ends of princes knit on to their
accession? Or is it a thing unheard of, that the barbarians should
cross their frontiers? Were those men Christians, in whose miserable
and unprecedented fate, in the one case a captive Emperor, in the other
a captive world[^79] proved the falsehood of the rites which promised
victory? Was there then no altar of Victory? I am ashamed of my
downfall, the pale cheeks of age gather redness from that disgraceful
bloodshed. I do not blush to be converted in my old age along with the
whole world. It is surely true that no age is too late to learn. Let
that old age blush which cannot improve itself. It is not the hoary
head of years but of virtue which is venerable. It is no disgrace to
pass to better things. This alone had I in common with the barbarians
that of old I knew not God. Your sacrifice is a rite of sprinkling
yourselves with the blood of beasts. Why do you look for the voice of
God in dead beasts? Come and learn here on earth a heavenly warfare;
we live here, but our warfare is above. Let God Himself, the Creator,
teach me the mystery of heaven, not man who knew not himself. Whom
should I believe about God, sooner than God Himself? How can I believe
you, who confess that you know not what you worship?’

8\. By a single path, he says, we cannot arrive at so great a secret.
What you are ignorant of, that we have learnt by the voice of God; what
you seek after by faint surmises, that we are assured of by the very
Wisdom and Truth of God. Our customs therefore and yours do not agree.
You ask the Emperors to grant peace to your gods, we pray for peace for
the Emperors themselves from Christ. You worship the works of your own
hands, we think it sacrilege that any thing which can be made should be
called God. God wills not to be worshipped under the form of stones.
Nay, your very philosophers have ridiculed this.

9\. But if you are led to deny that Christ is God, because you cannot
believe that He died, (for you are ignorant how that this was the death
not of His Godhead but of His flesh, whereby it comes to pass that none
of the faithful shall die,) how inconsistent are you, who insult by way
of worship, and disparage by way of honour. You consider your god to be
a block of wood; what an insulting kind of reverence! You believe not
that Christ could die; what a respectful kind of unbelief!

```{margin}
**Prov. xxi. 1.**
```

10\. But, he says, the ancient altars and images ought to be restored,
and the temples adorned as of old. This request ought to be made to one
who shares the superstition; a Christian Emperor has learned to honour
the altar of Christ alone. Why do they compel pious hands and faithful
lips to minister to their sacrilege? Let the voice of our Emperor speak
of Christ alone, let him declare Him only Whom in heart he believes,
for _the king’s heart is in the Hand of God_. Did ever heathen Emperor
raise an altar to God? In demanding a restoration of ancient things
they remind us what reverence Christian Emperors ought to pay to the
Religion which they profess, since heathen ones paid the utmost to
their own superstitions.

11\. Long since was our beginning, and now they follow us whom they
shut out. _We_ glory in shedding our blood, a trifling expense disturbs
_them_. We consider such things a victory, they esteem them an injury.
Never did they confer a greater favour on us than when they commanded
Christians to be scourged, and proscribed and slain. Religion made
into a reward what unbelief intended for a punishment. Behold their
magnanimity! _We_ have grown by wrongs, by want, by punishment; _they_
find that without money their ceremonies cannot be maintained.

12\. Let the Vestal virgins, he says, enjoy their privileges. It is for
those to say this, who cannot believe in gratuitous virginity, it is
for them to allure by profit who distrust virtue. But how many virgins
have their promised rewards obtained them? They have barely seven
Vestals. Such is the whole number whom the veiled and filleted head,
the dye of the purple vest, the pompous litter surrounded by attendants,
high privileges, great gains, and a prescribed period of virginity,
have collected.

13\. Let them turn their mental and bodily eye to us, let them behold
a people of chastity, an undefiled multitude, a virgin assembly. No
fillets to adorn their heads, but a veil of common use though dignified
by chastity; the blandishments of beauty not curiously sought out, but
cast aside; no purple trappings, no luxurious delicacies, but frequent
fastings; no privileges, no gains; all things in short so ordered as
to repress any affection in the very exercise of their functions. But
in fact by this very exercise their affection to it is conciliated.
Chastity is perfected by its own sacrifices. That is not virginity
which is bought for money, not preserved for love of holiness; that is
not integrity which is bid for at an auction by a pecuniary equivalent,
to last but for a time. The first triumph of chastity is to overcome
the desire of wealth, for this desire is a temptation to modesty.
But let us suppose that virginity ought to be supported by pecuniary
bounty. In this case, what an abundance of gifts will overflow upon
the Christians; what treasury will contain riches so great? Or do
they consider that it ought to be bestowed exclusively on the Vestal
virgins? Do not they, who claimed the whole under heathen Emperors,
feel some shame in denying that under Christian Princes we ought to
participate in the bounty?

14\. They complain also that public support is not given to their
priests and ministers. What a storm of words is here! To us on the
other hand the privileges of inheriting private property[^80] is denied
by recent laws, and no one complains; we do not feel it to be an injury,
for we grieve not at the loss. If a priest would claim the privilege
of being exempt from the municipal[^81] burthens, he must relinquish his
paternal estate and all other property. How would the heathens press
this ground of complaint, if they had it, that a priest must purchase
the liberty of performing his functions by the loss of his whole
patrimony, and at the expense of all his private advantages must buy
the right of ministering to the public, and while he claims to hold
vigils for the public safety must console himself with the wages of
domestic poverty; for he does not sell service but purchase a favour.

15\. Compare[^82] the two cases. You wish to exempt a Decurio, when the
Church may not exempt a priest. Wills are made in favour of ministers
of temples; not even profane persons, even of the lowest rank, nor of
abandoned character, are excepted; the clergy alone are excluded from
the common privilege, by whom alone the general prayer for all men
is offered, and the common office performed; no legacy, even of grave
widows, no donation is allowed. When no blame can attach to character,
a fine is imposed on the office. The legacy which a Christian widow
bequeaths to the minister of a temple is valid, that which she
bequeaths to the ministers of God is invalid. This I have stated not
by way of complaint, but that they may know how much I abstain from
complaining of, for I would rather we were losers in money than in
grace.

16\. But they report that gifts or legacies to the Church have not been
taken away. Let them state who has snatched gifts from the temples,
a loss which Christians have[^83] suffered. Had this been done to the
Gentiles, it would rather have been the requital than the infliction
of a wrong. Is it now only that they make a plea of justice, put in a
claim for equity? Where was this sentiment, when, having despoiled all
Christians of their goods, they grudged them the very breath of life,
and debarred them from that last burial-rite which was never before
denied to any of the dead? Those whom the heathen flung into it, the
sea restored. This is a victory of faith, that they themselves impugn
the acts of their ancestors, in that they condemn their proceedings.
But what consistency is there in condemning the acts of those whose
gifts they solicit?

17\. Yet no man has forbidden gifts to the temples, or legacies to the
soothsayers; their lands alone are taken away, because they did not use
that religiously which they claimed on the plea of religion. If they
avail themselves of our example why did they not copy our practice?
The Church possesses nothing but her faith. There are her rents, her
revenues. The wealth of the Church is the support of the poor. Let them
count up how many prisoners the temples have ransomed, what support
they have afforded to the poor, to how many exiles they have ministered
the means of life. Hence it is that they have been deprived of their
lands, but not of their rights.

18\. This is what has been done, and a public famine, as they assert,
has avenged this grave impiety, that the private emoluments of the
priests have been converted to the public service. For this cause they
say it was that men stripped branches of their bark, and moistened
their fainting life with this wretched juice. For this cause they
were obliged to substitute for corn the Chaonian acorn, and thrust
back again to this wretched fare, the food of beasts, they shook the
oaks and thus appeased their sore hunger in the woods. As if forsooth
these were new prodigies on earth, which never occurred so long as
heathen superstition prevailed over the world! But in truth how often
before this were the hopes of the greedy husbandmen frustrated by
empty oat-stalks, while the blade of corn sought for in the furrows
disappointed the race of peasants.

19\. Why did the Greeks attribute oracles to their oaks, but that they
fancied their sylvan fare was the gift of their heavenly religion?
Such are the gifts which they suppose to come from their gods. Who but
heathen ever worshipped the trees of Dodona, bestowing honour on the
sorry sustenance of the sacred grove[^84]? It is not probable that their
gods in their anger gave them for a punishment what they were wont when
appeased to confer as a gift.

20\. But what equity were it, that because they are annoyed at the
refusal of sustenance to a few priests they should themselves refuse it
to every one? in that case their vengeance is more severe than was the
fault. But in truth the cause they assign is not adequate to produce so
great infirmity of a failing world, as that, when the crops were green,
the full grown hopes of the season should all at once perish.

21\. Certain it is that many years ago the rights of the temples were
abolished throughout the world, is it only now that it has occurred to
the gods of the Gentiles to avenge their injuries? Can it be said that
the Nile failed to overflow his banks as usual, to avenge the losses
of the priests of the City, when he did not do so to avenge his own
priests?

22\. But supposing that in the past year it was the wrongs of their
gods that were avenged, why are the same wrongs neglected in the
present year? Now the country people do not pluck up and eat the roots
of herbs, nor seek solace from the sylvan berry, nor gather their food
from thorns; but rejoicing in their successful labours they wonder at
their own harvest, and their hopes fulfilled compensate for their fast,
the earth having yielded us her produce with interest.

23\. Who then is so inexperienced on human affairs as to be amazed at
the vicissitudes of the seasons? And yet even last year we know that
most provinces had an abundant harvest. What shall I say of Gaul which
was more fertile than usual? The Pannonias[^85] sold corn which they
had not sown, and the second[^86] Rhaetia learnt the danger of her own
fertility, for being used to security from her sterility, she drew
down an enemy on herself by her abundance. Liguria and Venice are
replenished by the fruits of autumn. So then the former year was not
withered by sacrilege, while the present has overflowed with the fruits
of faith. Nor can they deny that the vineyards produced an overflowing
crop. Thus our harvest yielded its produce with interest, and we
enjoyed the benefits of a more abundant vintage.

24\. The last and most weighty topic remains; as to whether your
Majesties should restore those aids which have been profitable to
yourselves, for he says, ‘Let them defend you, and be worshipped by
us.’ This, most faithful Princes, we cannot endure; that they should
make it a taunt to us that they supplicate their gods in your name,
and without your command commit an atrocious sacrilege, taking your
connivance as consent. Let them keep their guardians to themselves,
let these guardians, if they can, protect their own. But if they cannot
protect those who worship them, how can they protect you who worship
them not?

25\. Our ancestral rites, he says, should be preserved. But what if
all things have become better? The world itself, which at first was
compacted by the gathering together of the elemental seeds through
the vast void, an unconsolidated sphere, or was obscured by the thick
darkness of the yet unordered work, was it not afterwards endowed
with the forms of things which constitute its beauty, and were not the
heaven sea and earth distinguished from each other? The earth rescued
from dripping darkness was amazed at its new sun. In the beginning too
the day shines not, but as time goes on it is bright and warm with the
increase of light and heat.

26\. The moon herself, which in the prophetic oracles represents the
Church, when first she rises again, and repairs her monthly wanings,
is hidden from us by darkness, but gradually she fills her horns, or
completes them as she comes opposite to the sun, and gleams with a
bright and glorious splendour.

27\. In former days, the earth knew not how to be wrought into
fruitfulness; but afterwards when the careful husbandman began to till
the fields, and to clothe the bare soil with vineyards, it was softened
by this domestic culture, and put off its rugged nature.

28\. So too the first season of the year itself, which has imparted a
like habit to ourselves, is bare of produce, then, as time goes on, it
blossoms out in flowers soon to fade, and in the end finds its maturity
in fruits[^87].

29\. So we, while young in age, experience an infancy of understanding,
but as we grow in years lay aside the rudeness of our faculties.

30\. Let them say then that all things ought to have continued as at
first; that the world once covered with darkness is now displeasing
because it shines with the beams of the sun. And how much better is
it to have dispelled the darkness of the mind than that of the body,
and that the beam of faith has shone forth than that of the sun. So
then the early stages of the world as of all else have been unsettled,
that the venerable age of hoary faith might follow. Let those who are
affected by this find fault with the harvest too, because it ripens
late; or with the vintage, because it is in the fall of the year; or
with the olive, because it is the latest of fruits.

31\. So then our harvest too is the faith of the soul; the grace of the
Church is the vintage of good works, which from the beginning of the
world flourished in the saints, but in these last days is spread over
the people; to the intent that all might perceive that it is not into
rude minds that the faith of Christ has insinuated itself, but these
opinions which before prevailed being shaken off (for without a contest
there is no crown of victory) the truth was preferred according as is
just.

32\. If the old rites pleased, why did Rome adopt alien ones? I pass
over the covering of the ground with costly buildings, and shepherds’
huts glittering with the gold of a degenerate age[^88]. Why, to speak
of the very subject of their complaint, have they admitted in their
rivalry the images of captured cities, and of conquered gods, and the
foreign rites of an alien superstition? Whence do they derive their
precedent for Cybele washing her chariot in a stream to counterfeit the
Almo[^89]? Whence came the Phrygian seers, and the deities of faithless
Carthage ever hateful to Rome, her for instance, whom the Africans
worship as Cælestis[^90], and the Persians as Mitra, the greater part of
the world as Venus, the same deity under different names. So also they
have believed Victory to be a goddess, which is in truth a gift not a
power, is bestowed and does not rule, comes by the aid of legions not
by the power of religion. Great forsooth is the goddess whom the number
of soldiers claims, or the issue of the battle confers!

33\. And her altar they now ask to have set up in the Senate-house
at Rome, that is to say, where a majority[^91] of Christians assemble.
There are altars in all temples, an altar also in the temple of
victories. Being pleased with numbers, they celebrate their sacrifices
every where. But to insist on a sacrifice on this one altar, what is
it but to insult over the Faith? Is it to be borne that while a Gentile
sacrifices Christians must attend? Let their eyes, he says, drink in
the smoke whether they will or no; their ears the music; their mouth
the ashes; their nostrils the incense; and though they loathe it, let
the embers of our hearths besprinkle their faces. Is it not enough for
him that the baths, the colonnades, the streets are filled with images?
Even in that general assembly, are we not to meet upon equal terms?
The believing portion of the Senate will be bound by the voices of
them that call the gods to witness, by the oaths of them that swear by
them. If they refuse, they will seem to prove their falsehood, if they
acquiesce, to acquiesce in a sacrilege.

34\. Where, he asks, shall we swear allegiance to your Majesties’
laws and commands? Your minds then, of which your laws are the
outward expression, gather support and secure fidelity by heathen
rites. Moreover your Majesties’ faith is assailed not only when you
are present, but also, which is more, when you are absent, for you
constrain when you command. Constantius, of illustrious memory, though
not yet initiated into the sacred Mysteries, thought himself polluted
by the sight of that altar; he commanded it to be removed, he did not
command it to be replaced. His order bears all the authority of an Act,
his silence does not bear the authority of a precept.

35\. And let no one rest satisfied because he is absent. He is more to
be considered present who unites himself to the minds of others than he
who gives the testimony of his visible presence. It is a greater matter
to be united in mind than to be joined in body. The Senate regards you
as its presidents who summon its meetings; at your bidding it assembles;
to you, not to the gods of the heathen, does she resign her conscience;
you she prefers to her children though not to her faith. This is the
affection worth seeking, an affection more powerful than dominion, if
faith, which preserves dominion, be secured.

36\. But perhaps some one may be influenced by the thought that if so,
a most orthodox Emperor[^92] has been left without his reward; as if
the reward of good actions was to be estimated by the frail tenure of
things present. And what wise man is there who knows not that human
affairs move in a certain cycle and order, and meet not always with the
same success, but their state is subject to vicissitudes?

37\. Who more fortunate than Cneius Pompeius was ever sent forth by
the temples of Rome? But he, after compassing the circuit of the globe
in three triumphs, vanquished in battle, and driven into exile beyond
the bounds of the empire he had saved, perished by the hand of an
Eunuch[^93] of Canopus.

38\. What nobler king than Cyrus king of the Persians has the whole
Eastern world produced? He too, after he had conquered the most
powerful princes in battle, and detained them as his prisoners,
was worsted and slain by the arms of a woman[^94]. That king who had
conferred on the vanquished the honour of sitting at meat with him, had
his head cut off and enclosed in a vessel full of blood, and so was bid
to satiate himself, exposed to the mockery of a woman. So in the course
of his life like is not matched with like, but things most unlike.

39\. Again who was more assiduous in sacrificing than Hamilcar[^95]
general of the Carthaginians? During the whole time of the battle he
took his station between the ranks of the combatants, and there offered
sacrifice: then, when he found himself vanquished, he threw himself
upon the fire on which he was burning his victims, that he might
extinguish even with his own body those flames which he had learnt
availed him nothing.

40\. And what shall I say of Julian? who blindly believing the answers
of the diviners, deprived himself of the means of retreat[^96]. Thus
even when the circumstances are common there is not a common cause of
offence, for our promises have deluded no one.

41\. I have replied to those who harass me as though I had not been
harassed: for my object has been to refute their Memorial, not to
expose their superstitions. But let this very Memorial make your
Majesty more cautious. For by pointing out that of a series of former
Emperors, those who reigned first followed the rites of their ancestors,
and their successors did not remove them, and by observing upon this,
that if the religion of older ones was not an example, the connivance
of the more recent ones was, they have plainly shewn that you owe it
to the faith which you profess not to follow the precedent of heathen
rites, and to brotherly love not to violate your brothers’ ordinances.
For if they for the sake of their own cause have praised the connivance
of those Emperors, who being Christians, have not abrogated heathen
decrees, how much more are you bound to shew deference to brotherly
affection, and, whereas you would be bound to wink at what perhaps you
did not approve, for fear of detracting from your brothers’ decrees,
now to maintain what you judge to be in accordance both with your own
faith and the tie of brotherhood.

[^77]: This an official title of honour. There were three
    ranks among those who held office under the Emperors,
    1 Illustres, 2 Spectabiles, 3 Clarissimi, which is the
    one here applied to Symmachus. The latter was applied to
    all senators: the other two were reserved for the higher
    offices of state. See Gibbon, ch. xvii.

[^78]: He is referring apparently to Galba, Otho, and Vitellius,
    but somewhat exaggerates the brevity of their reigns.
    Galba reigned nearly seven months, Otho three months,
    Vitellius nearly eight months.

[^79]: The captive Emperor is Valerian, who, A.D. 260, was taken
    prisoner by Sapor king of Persia, and treated with the
    utmost indignity. The other is his son Gallienus, and S.
    Ambrose’s expression with regard to him may be explained
    by a sentence of Gibbon, (ch. xi. init.) ‘Under the
    deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the empire
    was oppressed and almost destroyed by the soldiers, the
    tyrants, and the barbarians.’

[^80]: S. Ambrose refers here to a law of Valentinian’s,
    forbidding the Clergy from receiving bequests from widows
    and unmarried females. It was addressed to Damasus, Bishop
    of Rome. S. Ambrose’s caution in de Off. Min. 1, 20, 87,
    shews that control was needed. S. Jerome, speaking of this
    law says, ‘I do not complain of the law, but grieve that
    we have deserved it.’

[^81]: In the provincial towns the political power in the times
    of the Emperors had passed into the hands of the curia or
    provincial Senate; and, with the power, many burdensome
    and extensive duties, were laid upon the curiales or
    decurions, as they were called. (See § 15.) Exemption from
    these had been granted first by Constantine; afterwards,
    as it was found that persons sought Holy Orders in order
    to evade civil duties, the privilege was restrained: and
    various changes were introduced by different Emperors.
    A full outline of the various laws is given in a learned
    note in Newman’s Fleury, vol. i. p. 162. where the text is
    speaking of S. Ambrose’s Letter to Theodosius, (infr. Lett.
    xl.) where he again complains of the same hardship. The
    subject is also more fully dealt with by Bingham Antiq.
    B. V. ch. iii. § 14–16.

[^82]: ‘Conferte’ is here adopted as a manifest emendation of
    ‘conferet.’ The transfer of two letters is a common
    mistake of copyists.

[^83]: This was the case in Julian’s reign, as may be seen in
    Theod. iii. 12.

[^84]: The reading of all the other Edd. ‘sacri nemoris’ for
    ‘agri nemorum’ is here adopted, as yielding a clearer
    sense.

[^85]: Pannonia was at this time divided into three provinces,
    viz. Pannonia Prima and Secunda, and Valeria Ripensis.

[^86]: Rhaetia Secunda was the name given to Vindelicia when
    separated again from Rhaetia proper, shortly before the
    time of Constantine: it had been united to it about the
    end of the first century.

[^87]: The Reading ‘nuda gignentium’ is adopted from Ed. Rom. The
    phrase occurs in Sallust Jug. 79, 6. ‘Gignentia’ is used
    for plants, trees &c. The clause ‘quae nos’ &c. is strange,
    but probably refers to the torpidity of winter, which is
    felt by man as well as by the lower creation.

[^88]: This passage seems suggested by reminiscences of Virgil,
    the phrase ‘absconditam pretio humum’ possibly from Aen.
    iv, 211. urbem Exiguam pretio posuit, while in the latter
    part S. Ambrose perhaps had in his mind the description of
    Evander’s town in Aen. viii. See especially ll. 347–366.

[^89]: The story of Cybele being brought to Rome, and landing
    outside the city, where the little stream of the Almo
    joins the Tiber, is told at length by Ovid, Fast. iv.
    250–348. In commemoration of the washing of the Statue
    and sacred implements at the landing, an annual ceremony
    was maintained, which seems to have been popular, from
    the numerous allusions to it in later writers. See
    Lucan 1. 600, Martial iii. 47. 2, Stat. Silv. v. 1. 222, Sil.
    Ital. viii. 365, all quoted in Dict. of Geogr. When the
    rites were performed away from Rome, the nearest river
    was conventionally made the Almo for the time. It is
    remarkable that Ammianus Marcellinus xxiii, 3, 7. mentions
    as one of the Emperor Julian’s lasts acts, his keeping the
    day of this rite, when on his last campaign against the
    Persians, and performing all the ceremonies at Callinicum
    or Nicephorium on the Euphrates.

[^90]: Venus Cælestis is a Latin equivalent of Ἀφροδίτη οὐρανία,
    and this name was transferred, according to Herodotus
    (Bk. i. ch. 105.) to the Phœnician goddess Astarte,
    or Ashtaroth. The same author also (B. i. ch. 131.)
    identifies Aphrodite with the Persian goddess Mitra,
    which however is shewn by Prof. Rawlinson, ad loc., to be
    an error, as Mithras is the sun-god of the Persians. The
    Temple of Venus Cælestis, or Astarte, at Carthage was very
    shortly after this time converted into a Christian Church,
    as recorded by Gibbon on the authority of Prosper Aquitan.
    (ch. xxviii).

[^91]: S. Ambrose’s repeated assertions, that the Christians
    formed a majority in the Senate, are characterised by
    writers unfavourable to Christianity as unfounded, but
    they produce no proof. Gibbon (ch. xxviii. note 12.)
    simply says that it is an assertion ‘in contradiction to
    common sense.’ But as a large majority of the Senate voted
    for the abolition of the worship of Jupiter about the same
    time, as Gibbon himself records, common sense would seem
    rather to agree with S. Ambrose.

[^92]: Referring to the unhappy end of Gratian who in the
    previous year (A.D. 383.) had been overpowered by Maximus,
    who revolted in Britain, and attacked him in Gaul. His
    troops deserted him and he was put to death by Maximus’
    orders.

[^93]: Pompeius was murdered, as he landed in Egypt, after
    escaping from Pharsalia, by Achillas an Eunuch and one of
    the guardians of king Ptolemy.

[^94]: Tomyris queen of the Massagetæ. See the story in Herod.
    i. 214.

[^95]: This is the first of the famous Hamilcars, the one who led
    the great invasion of Sicily in B.C. 480, and was totally
    defeated by Gelon. Herodotus, B. vii. ch. 167, tells the
    story to which S. Ambrose alludes as the account given by
    the Carthaginians of his end.

[^96]: S. Ambrose is alluding to the famous story of Julian
    burning his fleet, after crossing the Tigris to attack
    Sapor, king of Persia, in his dominions. This was regarded
    afterwards by the Christians as an act of judicial
    blindness. See Augustine de Civ. Dei iv. 29, v. 21.
    Ammianus, xxiv. 7. asserts that he repented of the order
    as soon as it was issued, but was too late to stop the
    flames. Gibbon endeavours to justify the act, and says,
    ‘had he been victorious we should now admire his conduct.’
    See his narrative in ch. xxiv. The author of his life in
    the Dict. of Ant. styles it ‘the best thing he could have
    done, if his march into the interior of Persia, had been
    dictated by absolute necessity.’ Setting these hypotheses
    aside, and looking only at the actual result, we may
    fairly think that the Christian interpretation of the
    facts, even if over-strongly expressed, is the truer.
